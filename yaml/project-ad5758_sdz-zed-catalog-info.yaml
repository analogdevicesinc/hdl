  description: >
    The AD5758 is a single-channel, voltage and current output digital-to-analog converter
    (DAC) that operates with a power supply range from −33 V (minimum) on AVSS to
    +33 V (maximum) on AVDD1 with a maximum operating voltage between the two rails
    of 60 V. On-chip DPC (dynamic power control) minimizes package power dissipation,
    which is achieved by regulating the supply voltage (VDPC+) to the VIOUT output
    driver circuitry from 5 V to 27 V using a buck dc-to-dc converter, optimized for
    minimum on-chip power dissipation. The CHART pin enables a HART signal to be coupled
    onto the current output.

    The device uses a versatile 4-wire serial peripheral interface (SPI) that operates
    at clock rates of up to 50 MHz and is compatible with standard SPI, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™,
    DSP, and microcontroller interface standards. The interface also features an optional
    SPI cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and a watchdog timer. The AD5758 offers improved
    diagnostic features from its predecessors, such as output current monitoring and
    an integrated 12-bit diagnostic ADC. Additional robustness is provided by the
    inclusion of a fault protection switch on VIOUT, +VSENSE, and −VSENSE pins.

    Applications:

    - Process control

    - Actuator control

    - PLC and distributed control systems (DCS) applications

    - HART network connectivity

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
