    The ARRADIO <https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=946>__ board
    is an HSMC <http://www.altera.com/literature/ds/hsmc_spec.pdf>__ board by Arrow
    <https://www.arrow.com/en/manufacturers/analog-devices>__ & Terasic <http://arradio.terasic.com/>_
    for the AD9361, a highly integrated RF Agile Transceiver. The complete chip level
    design package can be found on the ADI web site ad9361_design_files. Information
    on the card, and how to use it, the design package that surrounds it, and the
    software which can make it work, can be found on this page.

    The purpose of the ARRADIO board is to provide an RF platform which shows the
    maximum performance of the AD9361. It's expected that the RF performance of this
    platform can meet the datasheet specifications without issues at 2.4 GHz. This
    is due to the external Johanson Technology's 2450BL15B050E <https://www.johansontechnology.com/datasheets/baluns/JTI_Balun-2450BL15B050_12-03.pdf>__
    2.45 GHz Balun that is on the board. This balun is rated for an operating frequency
    of 2400~2500 MHz.

    This platform is primarily for hardware/RF investigation and bring-up of various
    waveforms from a RF team before their custom hardware is complete. Take a look
    at the :dokuwiki:Configuration options<resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/hardware/configuration_options>
    section).

    The ARRADIO board is very similar to the AD-ARRADIO-EBZ, except it utilizes the
    HSMC connector which connects to the Arrow SoCKit <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/sockit/arrow-development-tools>__
    .

    It targets the Intel Altera C5SOC.
