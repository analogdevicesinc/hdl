  title: AD4052-ARDZ HDL project
  description: >
    The HDL reference design for the AD4050, AD4052, AD4056, and AD4058. They are
    versatile, 16-bit/12-bit, successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs) that enable low-power, high-density data acquisition solutions
    without sacrificing precision. These ADCs offer a unique balance of performance
    and power efficiency, plus innovative features for seamlessly switching between
    high-resolution and low-power modes tailored to the immediate needs of the system.

    The AD4050/AD4052/AD4056/AD4058 are ideal for battery-powered, compact data acquisition
    and edge sensing applications.

    The EVAL-AD4050-ARDZ/EVAL-AD4052-ARDZ evaluation boards enable quick and easy
    evaluation of the performance and features of the AD4050 or the AD4052, respectively.

    This project has a spi_engine instance to control and acquire data from the precision
    ADC. This instance provides support for capturing continuous samples at the maximum
    sample rate.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
