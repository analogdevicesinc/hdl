    The ADALM-PLUTO Active Learning Module (PlutoSDR) is an easy to use tool available
    from Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) that can be used to introduce fundamentals of Software
    Defined Radio (SDR) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio>_ or
    Radio Frequency (RF) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency>_ or Communications
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_theory>_ as advanced topics in electrical
    engineering in a self or instructor lead setting.

    Based on the AD9363, it offers one receive channel and one transmit channel which
    can be operated in full duplex, capable of generating or measuring RF analog signals
    from 325 to 3800 MHz, at up to 61.44 Mega Samples per Second (MSPS) with a 20
    MHz bandwidth. The PlutoSDR is completely self-contained, fits nicely in a shirt
    pocket or backpack, and is entirely USB powered with the default firmware. With
    support for OS X™, Windows™ and Linux™, it allows exploration and understanding
    of RF systems no matter where the user is or when.

    The 2nd Rx/Tx channel internal to the rev D is not test during production test.
    If it works - bonus! If it doesn't work, Pluto is only advertised as a 1 Rx, 1
    Tx radio, and that is guaranteed/production tested on each unit - and that is
    what you received.
