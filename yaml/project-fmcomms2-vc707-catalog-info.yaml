    The AD-FMCOMMS2/3/4/5-EBZ are a high-speed analog modules designed to showcase
    the AD9361 or AD9364, a high performance, highly integrated RF agile transceiver
    intended for use in RF applications.

    The AD9361 and AD9364 chips operate in the 70MHz to 6GHz range, covering most
    licensed and unlicensed bands. The boards, due to discrete external components
    may have less performance on some of the RF input/output connectors (for example
    - the FMCOMMS2 and specific connectors on the FMCOMMS5 are specifically tuned
    to 2.4GHz). The AD9361 and AD9364 both supports channel bandwidths from less than
    200kHz to 56MHz by both changing sample rate, and by changing digital filters,
    and decimation inside the device itself.

    The digital interface consists of 12 bits of DDR data and supports full duplex
    operation in all configurations up to 2Ã—2. The transmit and receive data paths
    share a single clock. The data is sent or received based on the configuration
    (programmable) from separate transmit and to separate receive chains.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VC707.
