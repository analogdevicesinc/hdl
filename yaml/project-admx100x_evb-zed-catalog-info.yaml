  description: >
    The EVAL-ADMX1001 and EVAL-ADMX1002 modules are ultra-low-distortion, low-noise
    signal generators. They support output frequencies up to 40 kHz when the digital
    pre-distortion (DPD) algorithm is disabled, and up to 20 kHz with DPD enabled
    while maintaining a typical total harmonic distortion (THD) of −130 dB at 1 kHz.
    The ADMX1001 includes a built-in acquisition channel that enables simultaneous
    generation and capture of differential signals, making it ideal for characterization
    and closed-loop evaluation of high-performance ADCs, audio converters, and precision
    sensing systems. The integrated DPD algorithm minimizes distortion typically introduced
    by DAC and amplifier stages, enabling the generation of extremely clean test signals
    for precision measurement applications. The ADMX1002 focuses solely on high-fidelity
    signal generation, providing a streamlined solution for setups where local signal
    acquisition is not required. Note that in the current HDL release, only the TX
    path is implemented and supported.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
