  title: ETHERNET HDL IP core
  description: >
    The Corundum Ethernet Core is used by the Corundum Network Stack. The Ethernet
    Core is specific to each FPGA board and encompasses the Ethernet physical layer
    and other auxiliary structures such as SPI and I2C that are required by the Corundum
    system. The configurations are based on Corundum NIC <https://github.com/ucsdsysnet/corundum>__
    reference designs that were adapted to suit the ADI workflow.

    Depending on the board for which the IP is built, different HDL component diagrams
    will be available.
