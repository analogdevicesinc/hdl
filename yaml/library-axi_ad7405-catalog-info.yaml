  title: AXI AD7405 HDL IP core
  description: >
    The AXI AD7405 IP core can be used to interface the AD7405 device using an FPGA.
    The core has a AXI Memory Map interface for configuration, supports the data interface
    of the device, and has a simple FIFO interface for the DMAC.

    More about the generic framework interfacing ADCs, that contains the up_adc_channel
    and up_adc_common modules, can be read in axi_adc.
