  description: >
    The AD9434 is a 12-bit monolithic sampling analog-to-digital converter (ADC) optimized
    for high performance, low power, and ease of use. The part operates at up to a
    500 MSPS conversion rate and is optimized for outstanding dynamic performance
    in wideband carrier and broadband systems. All necessary functions, including
    a sample-and-hold and voltage reference, are included on the chip to provide a
    complete signal conversion solution. This reference design includes a data capture
    interface and the external DDR-DRAM interface for sample storage. It allows programming
    the device and monitoring its internal status registers. The board also provides
    other options to drive the clock and analog inputs of the ADC.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZC706.
