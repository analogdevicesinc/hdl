  description: >
    The ADALM2000 (M2K), is built around the XC7Z010 Xilinx Zynq FPGA.

    Booting is done from a 32MB QSPI FLASH, connected directly to the PS7 block.

    The system memory is 512MB RAM, which is also used for the file system. The DDR
    interface is a 16 bits interface running at 500 MHz. The frequency was chosen
    so that a single PLL runs inside of the PS7 block generating all the required
    PS7 clocks, consuming minimum power.

    The FPGA drives 16 GPIOs for the logic analyzer, 2 GPIOs for triggers, a 14 pin
    interface to the AD9963's ADC and a 14 pin interface to the AD9963's DAC. It also
    has several generic GPIOs, an SPI and an I2C interface for configuring the board.

    The control GPIOs and the SPI are driven by the PS7 block in order to minimize
    the PL resource usage.

    The I2C is implemented by an AXI I2C IP because the PS7 I2C has several limitations,
    which makes it not suitable for this project.

    The oscilloscope related logic transfers data from the AD9963 chip with the AD9963
    TRX interface goes through the decimation block, the analog triggering block,
    the history FIFO and streams data to memory using the DMA.

    The analog waveform generator transfers data from the memory using two DMAs, then
    goes through the interpolation block and ends with the AD9963 TX interface, which
    transfers data to the AD9963 chip. Two DMAs are used in order to have different
    orders of magnitude for the frequency of the two AWG channels, without needing
    to transfer a very large number of samples.

    The logic analyzer and pattern generator logic are mostly implemented in the same
    IP to which a history FIFO and DMAs are added.
