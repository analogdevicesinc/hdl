  title: ADRV9026_VCK190 HDL project
  description: >
    The ADRV9026 is a highly integrated, radio frequency (RF) agile transceiver offering
    four independently controlled transmitters, dedicated observation receiver inputs
    for monitoring each transmitter channel, four independently controlled receivers,
    integrated synthesizers, and digital signal processing functions providing a complete
    transceiver solution. The device provides the performance demanded by cellular
    infrastructure applications, such as small cell base station radios, macro 3G/4G/5G
    systems, and massive multiple in/multiple out (MIMO) base stations.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCK190.
