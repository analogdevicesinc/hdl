  description: >
    The AXI LTC235X IP core can be used to interface the LTC2358-18, LTC2358-16, and
    similar devices using an FPGA. The core has a AXI Memory Map interface for configuration,
    supports the CMOS and LVDS interfaces of the device, and has a simple FIFO interface
    for the DMAC. This documentation only covers the IP core and requires that one
    must be familiar with the devices for a complete and better understanding.

    This documentation only covers the IP core and requires that one must be familiar
