  description: >
    Demonstration circuit 2677A (DC2677A) is a reference design for robust industrial
    data acquisition applications for the LTC2358-18. The LTC2358-18 is capable of
    high voltage measurements with a large input common range; however, the DC2677A
    implements input protection that allows up to 400V of continuous input protection.
    Combined with gas discharge tubes, which provide protection from surges, the DC2677A
    is capable of surviving extreme abuse.

    This reference design includes the LTC2358-18 SAR ADC, ADA4522-2 dual zero-drift
    operational amplifier, and an LT6658 dual-output, high current reference for sensor
    excitation.

    The digital interface is an HSMC (high-speed mezzanine connector), which is compatible
    with Altera Cyclone V SoCkit and other Altera FPGA evaluation boards that support
    3.3V CMOS I/O.

    Applications:

    - Programmable Logic Controllers

    - Industrial Process Control

    - Power Line Monitoring

    - Test and Measurement

    It targets the Intel Altera C5SOC.
