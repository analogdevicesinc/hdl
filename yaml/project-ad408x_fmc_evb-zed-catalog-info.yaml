  title: AD408X-FMC-EVB HDL project
  description: >
    The EVAL-AD4080-FMC is designed to demonstrate the AD4080 performance.

    The EVAL-AD4080-FMC HDL design supports the following AD4080 features:

    - Single/Dual lane DDR data capture

    - Self synchronization using the fixed pattern and bit-slip feature

    - Capturing digital averaging filter with up to 2^10 decimation

    - Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) configuration via serial peripheral interface
    (SPI)

    - Sampling rate capability between 1.25 MSPS and 40 MSPS

    The EVAL-AD4080-FMC evaluation board was designed for use with the Digilent ZedBoard
    via the field programmable gate array(FPGA) mezzanine card (FMC) connector.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
