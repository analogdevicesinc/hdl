  title: AXI ADA4355 HDL IP core
  description: >
    The AXI ADA4355 IP core can be used to interface the ADA4355 device using an FPGA.
    The core has a AXI Memory Map interface for configuration, supports the data interface
    of the device, and has a simple FIFO interface for the DMAC. This documentation
    only covers the IP core and requires one to be familiar with the device, for a
    complete and better understanding.

    More about the generic framework interfacing ADCs can be read in axi_adc.
