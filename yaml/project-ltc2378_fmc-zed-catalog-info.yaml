  description: >
    The LTC23xx family consists of low noise, low power, high speed successive approximation
    register (SAR) ADCs with resolutions of 16-bit, 18-bit and 20-bit and maximum
    sampling rates from 250 kSPS to 2 MSPS. Operating from a 2.5V or 5V supply, these
    ADCs feature either fully differential or pseudo-differential input configurations
    with VREF ranging from 2.5V to 5.1V. The LTC2338-18 is a special variant operating
    from a single 5V supply with a ±10.24V true bipolar input range, making it ideal
    for high voltage applications which require a wide dynamic range.

    All devices in the family feature a high speed SPI-compatible serial interface
    that supports 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V logic while also featuring a daisy-chain
    mode. The fast throughput with no cycle latency makes the LTC23xx family ideally
    suited for a wide variety of high speed applications. An internal oscillator sets
    the conversion time, easing external timing considerations. The devices automatically
    power down between conversions, leading to reduced power dissipation that scales
    with the sampling rate.

    The LTC2376-16, LTC2376-18, LTC2376-20, LTC2377-16, LTC2377-18, LTC2377-20, LTC2378-16,
    LTC2378-18, LTC2378-20, LTC2379-18, LTC2380-16 variants feature a unique digital
    gain compression (DGC) function, which eliminates the driver amplifier's negative
    supply while preserving the full resolution of the ADC. When enabled, the ADC
    performs a digital scaling function that maps zero-scale code from 0V to 0.1 x
    VREF and full-scale code from VREF to 0.9 x VREF. For a typical reference voltage
    of 5V, the full-scale input range is now 0.5V to 4.5V, which provides adequate
    headroom for powering the driving amplifier from a single 5.5V supply.
