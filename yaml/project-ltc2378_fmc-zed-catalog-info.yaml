  description: >
    The LTC2378-20 is a low noise, low power, high speed 20-bit successive approximation
    register (SAR) ADC. Operating from a 2.5V supply, the LTC2378-20 has a ±VREF fully
    differential input range with VREF ranging from 2.5V to 5.1V. The LTC2378-20 consumes
    only 21mW and achieves ±2ppm INL maximum, no missing codes at 20 bits with 104dB
    SNR.

    The LTC2378-20 has a high speed SPI-compatible serial interface that supports
    1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V logic while also featuring a daisy-chain mode. The fast
    1Msps throughput with no cycle latency makes the LTC2378-20 ideally suited for
    a wide variety of high speed applications. An internal oscillator sets the conversion
    time, easing external timing considerations. The LTC2378-20 automatically powers
    down between conversions, leading to reduced power dissipation that scales with
    the sampling rate.

    The LTC2378-20 features a unique digital gain compression (DGC) function, which
    eliminates the driver amplifier's negative supply while preserving the full resolution
    of the ADC. When enabled, the ADC performs a digital scaling function that maps
    zero-scale code from 0V to 0.1 x VREF and full-scale code from VREF to 0.9 x VREF.
    For a typical reference voltage of 5V, the full-scale input range is now 0.5V
    to 4.5V, which provides adequate headroom for powering the driving amplifier from
    a single 5.5V supply.

    Applications:
