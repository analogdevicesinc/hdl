  title: AD7124-ASDZ HDL project
  description: >
    The HDL reference design for the AD7124-4 and AD7124-8 provides a 4/8-Channel,
    Low Noise, Low Power, 24-Bit, Sigma-Delta ADC with PGA and Reference.

    The AD7124-4/8 offers output data rates from 1.17 SPS up to 19,200 SPS. The AD7124-4/8
    can achieve simultaneous 50 Hz and 60 Hz rejection when operating at an output
    data rate of 25 SPS (single cycle settling), with rejection in excess of 80 dB
    achieved at lower output data rates.

    This project has a SPI instance to control and acquire data from the AD7124-4/8
    24-bit precision ADC. This instance provides support for capturing continuous
    samples at the maximum sample rate.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
