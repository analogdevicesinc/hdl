  description: >
    The AD-GMSL2ETH-SL is an edge compute platform enabling low-latency data transfer
    from eight Gigabit Multimedia Serial Linkâ„¢ (GMSL) interfaces on to a 10 Gb Ethernet
    link. The target applications include autonomous robots and vehicles where machine
    vision and real-time sensor fusion is critical.

    The system includes two MAX96724 Quad Tunneling GMSL2/1 to CSI-2 Deserializers,
    enabling connectivity to eight GMSL cameras. The video data from the cameras is
    transferred from the MAX96724 deserializers via MIPI CSI2 interfaces to an AMD
    K26 System on Module which implements the logic to aggregate the video data from
    all the GMSL cameras into a 10 Gb Ethernet link, so that it can be sent to a central
    processing unit.

    The IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) with hardware timestamping is supported,
    enabling accurate synchronization with host systems and other edge devices. The
    AD9545 Quad Input, 10-Output, Dual DPLL/IEEE 1588, 1 pps Synchronizer and Jitter
    Cleaner is used to generate the required clocks for the 10 Gb Ethernet interface
    and the PTP logic.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx K26.
