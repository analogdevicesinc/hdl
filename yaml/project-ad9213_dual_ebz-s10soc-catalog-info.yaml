  description: >
    The EVAL-AD9213-DUAL-EBZ platform includes two AD9213 single, 12-bit, 10 GSPS,
    radio frequency (RF) analog-to-digital converters (ADC) with the JESD204B interface.
    The two 10 GSPS data converters are interleaved to sample at 20 GSPS enabled by
    their built-in multi-chip synchronization capability.

    The ADF4377, high performance, ultra-low jitter, dual output integer-N phased
    locked loop (PLL) with an integrated voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), supports
    the interleaving. The LTC6955, low jitter, fanout clock buffer, and the LTC6952
    JESD204B clock generation and distribution IC enable a clocking architecture built
    for multi-channel scalability.

    The reference design is a processor based (e.g. ARM) embedded system. The device
    interfaces to the FPGA transceivers followed by the individual JESD204B and ADC
    cores. The cores are programmable through an AXI-Lite interface. The samples are
    initially captured by UTIL_ADCFIFO and then passed to the system memory (DDR).
    The user can capture up to 1048576 samples per channel, if both channels are selected
    or 2097152 per channel if only one channel is selected or in the case the data
    is considered single channel interposed. The platform allows users to direct sample
    L, S, and C bands, all while supporting up to 8GHz of IBW per channel.

    Features:

    - 20GSPS sample rate through interleaving supporting up to 8 GHz of instantaneous
    BW

    - Multi-chip synchronization (MCS) at 10GSPS using a scalable reference distribution
    architecture

    - Input network supporting a wde analog frequency range DC - 9GHz

    - Compact layout scheme that can be quickly adopted into a customer application

    It targets the Intel Altera S10SOC.
