  description: >
    The ADV7513 is a 165 MHz, High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI®) transmitter
    that is ideal for DVD players/ recorders, digital set-top boxes, A/V receivers,
    gaming consoles, and PCs.

    The digital video interface contains an HDMI v1.4/DVI v1.0-compatible transmitter
    and supports all HDTV formats. The ADV7513 supports HDMI v1.4-specific features,
    including 3D video. The ADV7513 also supports x.v.Color™, high bit rate (HBR)
    audio, and the programmable auxiliary video information (AVI) InfoFrame features.
    With the inclusion of HDCP, the ADV7513 allows the secure transmission of protected
    content as specified by the HDCP v1.4 protocol.

    The ADV7513 supports both S/PDIF and 8-channel I2S audio. Its high fidelity 8-channel
    I2S interface can transmit either stereo or 7.1 surround audio up to 768 kHz.
    The S/PDIF interface can carry compressed audio, including Dolby® Digital, DTS®,
    and THX®. Fabricated in an advanced CMOS process, the ADV7513 is provided in a
    64-lead LQFP surface-mount plastic package with exposed pad and is specified over
    the −25°C to +85°C temperature range.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
