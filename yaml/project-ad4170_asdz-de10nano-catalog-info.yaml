  description: >
    The HDL reference design for the AD4170-4 and AD4190-4 provides a high resolution,
    24-Bit, DC to 50 kHz Input Bandwidth, Multichannel, Low Noise Precision Sigma-Delta
    ADC with PGA.

    The data acquisition board incorporates the AD4170-4, a DC to 50 kHz input bandwidth,
    low noise, high speed, completely integrated analog front end for high precision
    measurement applications.

    The AD4170-4 offers output data rates from 7.6 SPS up to 500 kSPS, while the AD4190-4
    offers output data rates from 3.8 SPS up to 62.5 kSPS. The devices contains a
    low noise, 24-bit Σ-Δ analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and can be configured
    to have 4 differential inputs or 8 single-ended or pseudodifferential inputs.
    The on-chip low noise gain stage ensures that signals of small amplitude can be
    interfaced directly to the devices.

    This project has a spi_engine instance to control and acquire data from the AD4170-4
    or AD4190-4 24-bit precision ADC. This instance provides support for capturing
    continuous samples at the maximum sample rate.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
