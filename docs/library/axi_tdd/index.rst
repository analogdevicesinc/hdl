AXI TDD
================================================================================

.. hdl-component-diagram::

TDD (Time-Division Duplex) mode allows the user to control the time period of
the receive and transmit bursts.

The :git-hdl:`AXI Time-Division Duplexing <library/axi_tdd>` Controller IP core
is in essence a waveform generator capable of addressing RF applications which
require Time Division Duplexing, as well as controlling other modules of general
applications through its dedicated 32 channel outputs.

The reason of creating the generic TDD controller was to reduce the naming
confusion around the existing repurposed
:dokuwiki:`TDD core <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pzsdr2400tdd-eb/reference_hdl#TDD Controller>`
built for AD9361, as well as expanding its number of output channels for systems
which require more than six controlling signals.

Theory of Operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The central idea of the TDD controller is “frame”-based operation, i.e. all the
timing defined for the individual channels is relative to the beginning of a
frame. The ``FRAME_LENGTH`` value controls the length of a single frame, while
the ``BURST_COUNT`` value controls how many frames should be played after
enabling the device (a value of 0 means frames will be repeated indefinitely).
Before the start of a burst, an optional startup delay is inserted, defined by
the ``STARTUP_DELAY`` value in clock cycles.

This diagram tries to illustrate how the different channels can be enabled at
different times relative to the beginning of a frame.

.. note::

   While the above graphic shows all channels being enabled in a stacked
   manner, they are completely independent of each other!

Detailed Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to begin its operation, the peripheral must be enabled. This is done by
setting the ``ENABLE`` bit. Next, the peripheral waits to receive a sync signal.
There are 3 possible sync sources, which can be independently activated through
their corresponding enabling bits: ``SYNC_INT``, ``SYNC_EXT`` and ``SYNC_SOFT``
can all be active at the same time.

The external synchronization capability allows the alignment of frames between
multiple devices in different locations, for example using a GPSDO 1 PPS output.
The internal sync signal is generated based on a dedicated counter, when its
value matches the one defined in ``SYNC_COUNTER_LOW`` / ``SYNC_COUNTER_HIGH``.
The software generated sync pulse is triggered at an arbitrary point in time
when writing a ‘1’ value in ``SYNC_SOFT``.

The next diagram shows the peripheral’s FSM, which transitions between 4 states:
IDLE, ARMED, WAITING and RUNNING.

.. image:: fsm.svg

In case a synchronization signal is received while the TDD core is running, the
signal can reset the internal counter to zero by setting ``SYNC_RST`` to ‘1’.
This can alter the counter value in both WAITING or RUNNING states.

The generic TDD controller can have up to 32 output channels, each of them
having its unique values when the channel is set/reset under ``CHX_ON`` /
``CHX_OFF``. They are continuously compared to internal counter’s value while
the core is RUNNING.

Every bit in ``CHANNEL_ENABLE`` / ``CHANNEL_POLARITY`` corresponds to a specific
channel. The bit position is correlated to the channel index, so the LSB will
always be associated with CH0 and the MSB with CH31.

The following registers will not be updated unless the peripheral is disabled:

- ``BURST_COUNT``
- ``STARTUP_DELAY``
- ``FRAME_LENGTH``
- ``CHANNEL_POLARITY``
- ``SYNC_COUNTER_LOW``
- ``SYNC_COUNTER_HIGH``
- ``CHX_ON``
- ``CHX_OFF``

The user should configure them before enabling the peripheral. Any subsequent
write while the peripheral is enabled will be ignored.

An exception to this rule is ``CHANNEL_ENABLE``, which allows enabling /
disabling independent channels on-the-fly. The new value will come into effect
only when in ARMED state or at the end of a frame. ``CONTROL`` can also be
modified on-the-fly with immediate effect (after going through the
synchronization stage).

``STATUS`` can be used for debugging purposes, reflecting the current peripheral
state.

By adapting the synthesis parameters to the application requirements, the module
is highly flexible and can substantially reduce resource utilization.
