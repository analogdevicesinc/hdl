SPI Bus Interface
================================================================================

The SPI bus interface carries logical low-level SPI bus signals.

   * - Name

     - Description
   * - ``sclk``
     - Output
     - SPI Clock.
   * - ``sdo``
     - Output
     - SPI SDO (MOSI) signal.
   * - ``sdo_t``
     - Output
     - ``sdo`` tri-state enable. If 1 the MOSI signal should be tristated and
       not be connected to ``sdo``
   * - ``sdi``
     - Input
     - SPI SDI (MISO) signal. Execution module supports max 8 individual
       ``sdi`` lines.
   * - ``cs``
     - Output
     - SPI chip-select signal.
   * - ``three_wire``
     - Output
     - If set to 1 the bus should operate in three-wire mode. In three-wire
       mode ``sdi`` is connected to MOSI instead of MISO.

The SPI bus interface only carries a logical representation of the low-level SPI
bus signals. The top-level module in the FPGA design project is responsible for
translating the signal to physical SPI bus signals by instantiating and
connecting it to appropriate IO primitives.

The ``sclk`` and ``cs`` signals can typically be directly connected to a output
buffer. ``sdi`` should be connected to a mux, that depending on the setting of
the ``three_wire`` signal connects to a input buffer connected to the ``miso``
signal or to a input buffer connected to the ``mosi`` signal. The ``sdo`` signal
should be connected to a output tri-state buffer with the ``sdo_t`` signal
controlling the tri-state setting.

In some configurations three-wire support may not be required and ``sdi`` can
directly be connected to the input buffer for the ``miso`` signal. Similarly
when ``mosi`` tri-stating is not required the ``sdo`` signal can be directly
connected to the ``mosi`` signal leaving the ``sdo_t`` signal unconnected.

Example Verilog IO configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The following example Verilog code shows the most generic IO configuration,
 which represents the diagram above. Depending on system requirements some
 simplification might be possible.

Signals with phy prefix are assumed to be connected to the physical input/output
pins and signals with the spi prefix are assumed to be connected SPI-Engine bus
interface.

.. code-block:: verilog

   assign phy_sclk = spi_sclk;
   assign phy_cs = spi_cs;
   assign phy_mosi = spi_sdo_t ? 1'bz : spi_sdo;
   assign spi_sdi = spi_three_wire ? phy_mosi : phy_miso;
