SPI Engine Interconnect Module
================================================================================

.. hdl-component-diagram::

The :git-hdl:`SPI Engine Interconnect <library/spi_engine/spi_engine_interconnect`
allows connecting multiple :ref:`spi_engine control-interface` controllers to a single
:ref:`spi_engine control-interface` subordinate.
This enables multiple command stream generators to connect to a single
:ref:`spi_engine execution` and consequential give them access to the same SPI bus.
The interconnect modules take care of properly arbitrating between the different
command streams.

Combining multiple command stream generators in a design and connecting them to
a single execution module allows for the creation of flexible and efficient
designs using standard components.

Theory of Operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SPI Engine Interconnect module has multiple
:ref:`spi_engine control-interface` subordinate ports and a single
:ref:`spi_engine control-interface` controller port.
It can be used to connect multiple command stream generators to a single command
execution engine. Arbitration between the streams is done on a priority
basis, streams with a lower index have higher priority. This means if commands
are present on two streams arbitration will be granted to the one with the lower
index. Once arbitration has been granted the port it was granted to stays in
control until it sends a SYNC command. When the interconnect module sees a SYNC
command arbitration will be re-evaluated after the SYNC command has been
completed. This makes sure that once a SPI transaction consisting of multiple
commands has been started it is able to complete without being interrupted by a
higher priority stream.
