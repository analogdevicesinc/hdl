AXI Stream FIFO
================================================================================

.. hdl-component-diagram::

The :git-hdl:`AXI Stream FIFO <library/util_axis_fifo>` core
is a simple FIFO (First Input First Output) with AXI
streaming interfaces, supporting synchronous and asynchronous operation modes.
It can be used to mitigate data rate differences or transfer an AXI stream to a
different clock domain.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Supports Intel/Altera and Xilinx devices
* Configurable data width and depth
* Support asynchronous (double clocked) mode
* Supports TLAST to indicate packet boundary
* Supports FULL/EMPTY and ALMOST_FULL/ALMOST_EMPTY status signals
* Support zero-deep implementation

Detailed Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The util_axis_fifo is a generic First Input First Output module, that can be
used to control clock and data rate differences or to do data buffering on a
AXI4 stream based data path. FIFO's write interface is an AXI4 slave streaming
interface, and the FIFO's read interface is an AXI4 master streaming interface.
The depth of the FIFO is defined by the equation, which is a function of the
ADDRESS_WIDTH and DATA_WIDTH parameters:

**FIFO depth in bytes = DATA_WIDTH/8 \* 2 ^ ADDRESS_WIDTH**

The FIFO has three different status indicator ports on both side, which provides
information about the state of the FIFO for both the source and destination
logic:

-  FULL or EMPTY - If these outputs are asserted the FIFO is full or empty. In
   case of a full FIFO all the write operations are suspended. In case of an
   empty FIFO all the read operations are suspended.
-  ALMOST_EMPTY/ALMOST_FULL - It can be used to foresee a potential FULL or
   EMPTY state, asserting before the EMPTY/FULL before a predefined number of
   word. The offset between ALMOST_EMPTY and EMPTY, and between ALMOST_FULL and
   FULL can be set by using the parameters ALMOST_EMPTY_THRESHOLD and
   ALMOST_FULL_THRESHOLD.
-  S_AXIS_ROOM - Indicate how many word can be written in the FIFO at the
   current moment, until the FIFO become FULL.
-  M_AXIS_LEVEL - Indicate how many word can be read from the FIFO at the
   current moment, until the FIFO become EMPTY.

.. important::

   In case of asynchronous mode, because of the delays introduced
   by the clock domain crossing logic, the ROOM and LEVEL indicators can not
   reflect the actual state of the FIFO in real time. Source and destination logic
   should take this into account when controlling the data stream into and from the
   FIFO. Carefully adjusting the ALMOST_EMPTY/ALMOST_FULL indicators can provide a
   save operating margin.
