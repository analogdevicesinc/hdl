   See :ref:`library` for a list of IP cores by category.

In case you want the same project for that evaluation board, but you need it
to be on another FPGA carrier and also do some extra processing, please take a
look at our :ref:`porting_project` guide on how to migrate the project onto
another FPGA + the above pages, for details on how to add the IPs into your
customized project (:ref:`customize_hdl`).
