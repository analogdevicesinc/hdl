  * For converters from the ADI SigmaDelta family the data ready interrupt
  * signal uses the same physical wire as the the DOUT signal for the SPI bus.
  * This module extracts the data ready signal from the SPI bus and makes sure
  * to suppress false positives. The data ready signal is indicated by the
  * converter by pulling DOUT low. This will only happen if the CS pin for the
  * converter is low. There is a small delay between the end of the SPI transfer
  * and the point where the converter starts to indicate the data ready signal.
  * IDLE_TIMEOUT allows to specify the amount of clock cycles the bus needs to
  * be idle before the data ready signal is detected.
