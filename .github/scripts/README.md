# Guidelines & files check scripts

These scripts are used for checking the integrity and correctness of the files across the HDL repository. The first script called **check_for_missing_readme_md.sh** is used to check the correctness of the README files only while the second script called **check_guideline.py** has the sole role of checking if our guidelines are implemented across the other files.

## User guide for [check_readme.sh](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl/blob/main/.github/scripts/check_readme.sh)

### Prerequisites

- The script must be run from the root of the HDL repository (e.g., `/hdl`);
- It assumes a directory structure like:
  - `projects/<board>/README.md`
  - `projects/<board>/<carrier>/README.md`
- It requires `bash` or `sh`, but it **does not** require any external dependencies.

### Purpose

This script ensures that all HDL project directories contain properly formatted `README.md` files and that they follow documentation conventions.

### Rules that are checked

#### 1. Presence of README files

- Each board directory (e.g., `projects/adrv9009zu11eg/`) must contain a `README.md`;
- Each carrier subdirectory (e.g., `projects/adrv9009zu11eg/zcu102/`) must also contain a `README.md`.

#### 2. Title format

- The main board README must have a title in the format: `<BOARD-NAME> HDL Project`.
  Example: `# ADRV9009ZU11EG HDL Project`;
- Carrier README titles must follow the format: `<BOARD-NAME>/<CARRIER-NAME> HDL Project`
  Example: `ADRV9009ZU11EG/ZCU102 HDL Project`;
- **Board names** are uppercased and underscores are replaced with hyphens (e.g., `ad9081_fmca_ebz` → `AD9081-FMCA-EBZ`);
- **Carrier names** are uppercased as-is (e.g., `de10nano` → `DE10NANO`), except for special carriers.

#### 3. Special carrier exceptions

The following carriers are allowed to use underscore in their README titles and are not flagged for title mismatches:

- `ccbob_*`
- `ccfmc_*`
- `ccpackrf_*`
- `adrv2crr_fmc`
- `adrv2crr_fmcomms8`
- `adrv2crr_fmcxmwbr1`

Based on the case, you can add special carriers by modifying the script.

```sh
# Function to detect special carriers (e.g., ccbob_cmos, ccfmc_lvds)
is_special_carrier() {
    case "$1" in
        ccbob_*|ccfmc_*|ccpackrf_*|adrv2crr_fmc|adrv2crr_fmcomms8|adrv2crr_fmcxmwbr1)
            return 0
            ;;
        *)
            return 1
            ;;
    esac
}
```

#### 4. Required sections

- **Main board README** MUST contain:
  - `Building the project`
  - `Supported parts`
- **Carrier README** SHOULD contain all the below sub-sections*:
  - `Building the project`
  - `Example configurations`
  - A mention of a **default configuration** under the `Example configurations` section

```
* If it's not possible, you MUST include the following flags, depedinding on your case (on what sub-section cannot be included):
  - no_build_example: this project doesn't have the Example configurations section, so it doesn't have build parameters
  - no_dts: this project doesn't have a device tree associated
  - no_no_os: this project doesn't have a no-OS project associated

Include these flags on the first line of the README.md file, as a MarkDown comment, like this (depeding on what you can't include):

<!-- no_build_example, no_dts, no_no_os -->
```

#### 5. Forbidden content

- Links to the following are not allowed:
  - `https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers-all`
  - `https://wiki.analog.com/linux`
- Empty Markdown links like `` or `([ ])` are flagged.

### Output

The script prints a summary for each board and carrier, indicating:

- ✔ if the README is valid
- ✖ if there are issues, with a description of what’s missing or incorrect

At the end, if any issues are found, it prints: **Something occurred! Check the output of the script.**

### Example of running

```sh
cd hdl/
source .github/scripts/check_for_missing_readme_md.sh
```

## User guide for [check_guideline.py](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl/tree/main/.github/scripts/check_guideline.py)

### Prerequisites

- the script must be run while being in the root directory (/hdl)
- clean the repository to remove the files generated by Vivado
- it will be run only on Verilog files that do not contain "tb" in their path
- doesn't run on SystemVerilog files
- uses Python 3.x

### Rules that are checked

These rules can be found in the [HDL coding guidelines](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/user_guide/hdl_coding_guidelines.html).

#### 1. License header

It checks if the license header is up-to-date, containing the current year in
the year range. Exceptions are the JESD files and the ones specified in the
`avoid_list` string list.
If `-e` option is added, the script can update the year range.

#### 2. Two or more consecutive empty lines

It checks in the whole file if there are two or more consecutive empty lines.
If `-e` option is added, the script can remove them and leave only one empty line.

#### 3. Trailing whitespace

It checks if there are whitespace characters at the end of the lines.
If `-e` option is added, then they can be removed.

#### 4. Lines after `endmodule` tag

It checks if there are  lines after it.
If `-e` option is added, the script can remove them.

#### 5. Parentheses around the module declaration

It checks if the parentheses around the module declaration (meaning `) (` for
the parameters' list) are on an empty line, right after the last parameter.
It also checks for the closing parenthesis at the module declaration (meaning `);`)
to be on an empty line, at the beginning, right after the last I/O port line.
If `-e` option is added, the script can put them in their proper place.

#### 6. Indentation of code

It checks if all lines (except for the ones that are commented) have an indentation
of two or multiple of two spaces.
Other exceptions to this are the `module` line, the `endmodule` line, the `) (`
and the `);` from the module declaration.

#### 7. Position of the module instances

It checks if the parameters' list (if that's the case) is in proper position,
meaning that the position of `#` is checked, the parameters to be specified each
on its own line, the parentheses around the instance name and the closing parenthesis
of the module instance.

_NOTE_: these rules are marked in the script with **GC** (stands for Guideline Check)
in the comments.

### Changes done by the script to your files

If one wants the script to make changes in files, they will be regarding:

- license header, except for JESD files and the ones specified in `avoid_list`
- two or more consecutive empty lines
- trailing whitespaces
- lines after `endmodule` tag
- parentheses around the module declaration (meaning `) (` for the parameters'
  list and `);` for when closing the declaration)

### Ways to run the script

1. With no arguments: `python3 check_guideline.py`
Checks all files with the properties specified above.
Does not modify the files.

2. With arguments:
    1. `-e` with no file specified
      Checks all files with the properties specified above. Additionally,
      it modifies the module definition parentheses according to the guideline.
    2. `-m`
      Checks files that are given as arguments (by their names including the
      extension).
    3. `-me`
      Checks files that are given as arguments (by their names including the
      extension) and modifies the files where the guideline is not respected.
    4. `-p`
      Checks files that are given as arguments (by their relative path) and
      modifies the files where the guideline is not respected.
    5. `-pe`
      Checks files that are given as arguments (by their relative path) and
      modifies the files where the guideline is not respected.

### Examples of running

```
python3 check_guideline.py     >> warnings.txt
python3 check_guideline.py -e  >> warnings.txt
python3 check_guideline.py -m  axi_ad9783.v >> warnings.txt

python3 check_guideline.py -p  ./library/axi_ad9783/axi_ad9783.v ./library/common/up_adc_common.v >> warnings.txt
python3 check_guideline.py -pe ./library/axi_ad9783/axi_ad9783_if.v >> warnings.txt
```
