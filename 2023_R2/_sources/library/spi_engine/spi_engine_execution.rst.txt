SPI Engine Execution Module
================================================================================

.. hdl-component-diagram::

The :git-hdl:`SPI Engine Execution <library/spi_engine/spi_engine_execution>`
IP core is the heart of the SPI Engine framework.
It is responsible for handling a SPI Engine control stream and translates it
into low-level SPI bus transactions.

Theory of Operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SPI Engine Execution module implements the physical access to the SPI bus.
It implements a small but powerful programmable state machine that translates a
SPI Engine command stream into low-level SPI bus access.

Communication with a command stream generator happens via the ``ctrl``
interface and the low-level SPI access is handled on the ``spi`` interface.
The ``active`` signal is asserted as long as the peripheral is busy executing
incoming commands.

Internally the SPI Engine execution module consists of an instruction encoder
that translates the incoming commands into an internal control signal, a
multi-function counter and compares unit that is responsible for handling the
timing and a shift register which holds the received and transmitted SPI data.

The module has an optional programmable pre-scaler register that can be used to
divide the external clock to the counter and compare unit.
