SPI Engine Control Interface
================================================================================

The SPI Engine Control Interface is used to exchange data between different
cores within the SPI Engine framework. It is used to exchange the commands and
synchronization points as well as the SPI bus transmit and receive data.

The interface consists of four streams:

* The CMD stream which carries the SPI Engine commands. (Manager to Subordinate)
* The SDO stream which carries the to be transmitted data for the SPI bus.
  (Manager to Subordinate)
* The SDI stream which carries the received data from the SPI bus. (Subordinate to
  Manager)
* The SYNC stream which carries the synchronization events. (Subordinate to Manager)

Each of the streams has a valid, ready and data signal. They follow the
handshaking protocol as defined by the AXI standard. Meaning the manager asserts
valid when the data on the data signal is valid and the subordinate asserts ready
when it is able to accept new data. If both valid and ready are asserted at the same
time the data has been transmitted from the manager to the subordinate.
