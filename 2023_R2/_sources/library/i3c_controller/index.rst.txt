I3C Controller is subset of the I3C-basic specification to interface peripherals
such as ADCs through I3C.

It consist out of two sub-modules which communicate over well defined interfaces.
The :ref:`i3c_controller core` is a lean but powerful execution module, which
implements the I3C bus control logic.
It is controlled by a command stream generated by the :ref:`i3c_controller host_interface`,
which parses the :ref:`i3c_controller command_descriptors`.

The :ref:`i3c_controller offload-interface` operation mode allows to execute
a pre-programmed command stream when triggered by an external event, allowing for
minimal latency.


Sub-modules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* :ref:`i3c_controller host_interface`: Memory mapped software accessible
  interface to a I3C Controller command stream and/or offload cores.
* :ref:`i3c_controller core`: Main module which executes a I3C Controller command
  stream and implements the I3C bus interface logic.

Interfaces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* :ref:`i3c_controller control-interface`: Command descriptors.
* :ref:`i3c_controller offload-interface`: Command descriptors for cyclic operation,
  with SDI data generally consumed by a DMA.

Software
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* :git-linux:`Linux Driver <i3c:drivers/i3c/master/adi-i3c-master.c>`:
  Linux driver for the I3C Controller.
* :ref:`i3c_controller instruction-format`: Overview of the I3C Controller
  instruction format.
