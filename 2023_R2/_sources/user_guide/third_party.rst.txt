Third party forks
===============================================================================

All the IPs and projects that are part of our HDL repository are tested
by the ADI team.

In some cases, there are third-party forks that either add new projects
with our evaluation boards on unsupported carriers, or add some
functionality that is not found in our ADI HDL repository.

As we cannot maintain and test these repositories, they still can be
helpful, so we're listing them here.
