Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Analog Devices, Inc.`_ will provide **limited** online support for anyone
using the :git-hdl:`reference design <>` with `ADI`_ components via the
:ez:`fpga` FPGA reference designs forum.

For questions regarding the `ADI`_ Linux device drivers, device trees, etc.
from our :git-linux:`Linux GitHub repository <>`, the team will offer support
on the :ez:`linux-software-drivers` Linux software drivers forum.

For questions concerning the `ADI`_ No-OS drivers, from our
:git-no-os:`No-OS GitHub repository <>`, the team will offer support on the
:ez:`microcontroller-no-os-drivers` microcontroller No-OS drivers forum.

It should be noted, that the older the tools' versions and release branches
are, the lower the chances to receive support from `ADI`_ engineers.
