  title: CN0540 HDL project 2023_R2
  description: >
    The HDL reference design for the CN0540 provides a high resolution, wide-bandwidth,
    high dynamic range, Integrated Electronics Piezoelectric (IEPE) compatible interface
    data acquisition system (DAQ) for interfacing with Integrated Circuit Piezo (ICP)/IEPE
    piezo vibration sensors. Most solutions which interface with piezo sensors in
    the market are AC coupled, lacking DC and sub-hertz measurement capability. This
    reference design is a DC coupled solution in which DC and sub-hertz precision
    are achieved. By looking at the complete data set from the vibration sensor in
    the frequency domain (DC - 50 kHz), the type and source of a machine fault can
    be better predicted using the; position, amplitude and number of harmonics found
    in the FFT spectrum.

    The data acquisition board incorporates a precision 24-bit, 1024kSPS Sigma-delta
    ADC AD7768-1 and a 16-bit voltage output DAC LTC2606. Used as the ADC driver is
    a high linearity FDA ADA4945-1 and a 200mA programmable 2-terminal current source
    LT3092. Analog input protection is provided by the switch ADG5421F.

    This project has a SPI Engine instance to control and acquire data from the AD7768-1
    24-bit precision ADC. This instance provides support for capturing continuous
    samples at the maximum sample rate.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
