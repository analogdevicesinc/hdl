  description: >
    The AD5766/ AD5767 are 16-channel, 16-/12-bit, voltage output Digital-to-Analog
    Converters (DAC). The DAC generates output voltage ranges from an external 2.5
    V reference. Depending on the span selected, the mid-point of the output span
    can be adjusted allowing for a minimum output voltage as low as −20 V or a maximum
    output voltage of up to +14 V.

    The AD5766/ AD5767 have integrated output buffers which can sink or source up
    to 20 mA. This makes the AD5766/AD5767 suitable for Indium Phosphide Mach Zehnder
    Modulator (InP-MZM) biasing applications.

    The part incorporates a power-on reset circuit that ensures that the DAC outputs
    power up to 0V and remain at this level until the output range of the DAC is configured.
    The outputs of all DACs are updated through register configuration, with the added
    functionality of user-selectable DAC channels to be simultaneously updated.

    The AD5766/ AD5767 require four power supplies. AVCC is the analog supply for
    the low voltage DAC circuitry. AVDD and AVSS are the positive and negative high
    voltage power supplies for the output amplifiers. A VLOGIC supply pin is provided
    to set the logic levels for the digital interface pins. The AD5766/ AD5767 utilize
    a versatile 4-wire serial interface that operates at clock rates of up to 50 MHz
    for write mode and up to 10MHz for readback and daisy-chain mode, and is compatible
    with SPIR, QSPI., MICROWIRE. and DSP interface standards.

    The AD5766/ AD5767 are available in a 4mm x 4mm WLCSP package and operates at
    the range of -40C to +105C.

    Applications:
     - Mach Zehnder Modulator Bias Control
     - Analog Output Modules
     - Process Control
    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
