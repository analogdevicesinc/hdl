  description: >
    Depending on the type of connector it uses, the Pulsar family is divided into
    the products which have PMOD connectors and FMC connectors.

    PulSAR converters which have PMOD boards associated with them are low power ADCs
    which offer very high performance from 14-bits up to 18-bits with throughputs
    ranging from 100ksps to 1.3MSPS. The boards are designed to demonstrate the ADC's
    performance and to provide an easy digital interface for a variety of system applications.
    The PulSAR family share the same interface and the same PCB, the differences being
    found in their performance. A full description of these products are available
    in their respective data sheets and should be consulted when utilizing the boards.

    ADAQ40xx families is also part of the family of pulsar converters with PMOD connector.
    This type of boards come with the EVAL-PMD-IB1Z PMOD to field programmable gate
    array (FPGA) mezzanine card (FMC) interposer board that interfaces with the system
    demonstration controller board. The ADAQ4003 is an 18-bit precision data acquisition
    sub-system SiP design on a laminate that includes the AD4003 ADC with a fully
    differential driver the ADA4945-1, a reference buffer (the ADA4807-1), a precision
    resistor iPassive network on a separate die along with discrete capacitors and
    resistors. The device solves many design challenges for a wide range of applications
    similar to AD400x, yet it still provides the flexibility. It offers over 75% area
    savings compared to discrete design and reduces TTM.

    PulSAR converters which have FMC boards associated with them are AD40xx family.
    The AD4003 / AD4007 / AD4011 / AD4020 are low noise, low power, high speed, 18-bit,
    precision successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters
    (ADCs). The AD4003, AD4007, and AD4011 offer 2 MSPS, 1 MSPS, and 500 kSPS throughputs,
    respectively. They incorporate ease of use features that reduce signal chain power
    consumption, reduce signal chain complexity, and enable higher channel density.
    The high-Z mode, coupled with a long acquisition phase, eliminates the need for
    a dedicated high power, high speed ADC driver, thus broadening the range of low
    power precision amplifiers that can drive these ADCs directly while still achieving
    optimum performance. The input span compression feature enables the ADC driver
    amplifier and the ADC to operate off common supply rails without the need for
    a negative supply while preserving the full ADC code range. The low serial peripheral
    interface (SPI) clock rate requirement reduces the digital input/output power
    consumption, broadens processor options, and simplifies the task of sending data
    across digital isolation.

    Applications:
     - Battery-powered equipment
     - Data acquisition
     - Instrumentation
     - Medical instruments
     - Process controls
     - Machine automation
    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
