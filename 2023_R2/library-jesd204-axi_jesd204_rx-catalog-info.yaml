  description: >
    The Analog Devices JESD204B/C Link Receive Peripheral implements the link layer
    handling of a JESD204 receive logic device. Implements the 8B/10B based link layer
    defined in JESD204C standard that is similar to the link layer defined in JESD204B.
    This includes handling of the SYSREF and SYNC~ and controlling the link state
    machine accordingly as well as performing per lane descrambling and character
    replacement. Implements the 64B/66B based link layer defined in the JESD204C standard.
    This includes handling of the SYSREF, per lane decoding of sync header, descrambling,
    CRC checking of data blocks and error monitoring.

    The type of link layer is selectable during implementation phase through the LINK_MODE
    synthesis parameter.

    It has been designed for interoperability with Analog Devices JESD204 ADC converter
    products. To form a complete JESD204 receive logic device, it has to be combined
    with a PHY layer and transport layer peripheral.
