  description: >
    The Analog Devices JESD204B/C Link Transmit Peripheral implements the link layer
    handling of a JESD204 transmit logic device. Implements the 8B/10B based link
    layer defined in JESD204C standard that is similar to the link layer defined in
    JESD204B. This includes handling of the SYSREF and SYNC~ and controlling the link
    state machine accordingly as well as performing per lane scrambling and character
    replacement. It has been designed for interoperability with Analog Devices JESD204B
    DAC converter products. Implements the 64B/66B based link layer defined in the
    JESD204C standard. This includes handling of the SYSREF, per lane encoding of
    sync header, scrambling as per data multi-block CRC generation.

    The type of link layer is selectable during implementation phase through the LINK_MODE
    synthesis parameter.

    To form a complete JESD204 transmit logic device it has to be combined with a
    PHY layer and transport layer peripheral.
