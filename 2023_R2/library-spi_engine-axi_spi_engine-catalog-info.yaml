  title: AXI_SPI_ENGINE HDL IP core 2023_R2
  description: >
    The AXI SPI Engine IP core allows asynchronous interrupt-driven memory-mapped
    access to a SPI Engine Control Interface. This is typically used in combination
    with a software program to dynamically generate SPI transactions.

    The peripheral has also support for providing memory-mapped access to one or more
    spi_engine offload cores and change its content dynamically at runtime.
