  description: >
    The AD7768-1/ADAQ7768-1 is a low power, high performance, Σ-Δ analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC), with a Σ-Δ modulator and digital filter for precision conversion
    of both AC and DC signals. The AD7768-1 is a single channel version of the AD7768,
    an 8-channel, simultaneously sampling, Σ-Δ ADC. The AD7768-1 provides a single
    configurable and reusable data acquisition footprint, which establishes a new
    industry standard in combined AC and DC performance and enables instrumentation
    and industrial system designers to design across multiple measurement variants
    for both isolated and nonisolated applications.

    The AD7768-1 achieves a 108.5 dB dynamic range when using the low ripple, finite
    impulse response (FIR) digital filter at 256 kSPS, giving 110.8 kHz input bandwidth
    (BW), combined with ±1.1 ppm integral nonlinearity (INL), ±30 µV offset error,
    and ±30 ppm gain error. Wider bandwidth, up to 500 kHz Nyquist, 204 kHz, −3 dB,
    is available using the sinc5 filter, enabling a view of signals over an extended
    range.

    A 1.024 MHz sinc5 filter path exists for users seeking an even higher output data
    rate. This path is quantization noise limited; therefore, it is best suited for
    customers requiring minimum latency for control loops or implementing custom digital
    filtering on an external field programmable gate array (FPGA) or digital signal
    processor (DSP).

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
