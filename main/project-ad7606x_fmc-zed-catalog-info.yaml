  description: >
    The AD7606 is a 8-/6-/4-Channel DAS with 16-Bit, Bipolar Input, Simultaneous Sampling
    ADC. Each part contains analog input clamp protection, a second-order antialiasing
    filter, a track-and-hold amplifier, a 16-bit charge redistribution successive
    approximation analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a flexible digital filter, a
    2.5 V reference and reference buffer, and high speed serial and parallel interfaces.
    The AD7606 operate from a single 5 V supply and can accommodate ±10 V and ±5 V
    true bipolar input signals while sampling at throughput rates up to 200 kSPS for
    all channels. The input clamp protection circuitry can tolerate voltages up to
    ±16.5 V. The AD7606 has 1 MΩ analog input impedance regardless of sampling frequency.
    The single supply operation, on-chip filtering, and high input impedance eliminate
    the need for driver op amps and external bipolar supplies.

    The AD7606C is a directly pin replacement (software and hardware) for both AD7608
    and AD7609, with higher input impedance, throughput rate and extended temperature
    range with additional features such as 16/18-bit sample size, system gain/offset/phase
    calibration, sensor disconnect detection, lower Vdrive operation, diagnostics,
    additional oversampling ratios and per channel analog input range selection with
    bipolar differential, bipolar single-ended and unipolar single-ended options.

    The EVAL-AD7606B-FMCZ and EVAL-AD7606C-18 evaluation boards are designed to help
    users to easily evaluate the features of AD7606B, AD7606C-16 and AD7606C-18 analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs).

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
