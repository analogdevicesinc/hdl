  description: >
    Depending on the type of connector it uses, the PulSAR family is divided into
    the products which have PMOD connectors and FMC connectors.

    PulSAR converters which have PMOD boards associated with them are low power ADCs
    which offer very high performance from 14-bits up to 18-bits with throughputs
    ranging from 100ksps to 1.3MSPS. The boards are designed to demonstrate the ADC's
    performance and to provide an easy digital interface for a variety of system applications.
    The PulSAR family share the same interface and the same PCB, the differences being
    found in their performance. A full description of these products are available
    in their respective data sheets and should be consulted when utilizing the boards.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
