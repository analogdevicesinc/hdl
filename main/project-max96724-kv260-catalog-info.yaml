  title: MAX96724 HDL project
  description: >
    The MAX96724 deserializer converts four GMSL™2/1 inputs to 1, 2, or 4 MIPI D-PHY
    or C-PHY outputs. The device allows simultaneous transmit bidirectional transmissions
    over 50Ω coax or 100Ω STP cables that meet the GMSL channel specification.

    Up to four remotely located sensors can be supported using industry-standard coax
    or STP interconnects. Each GMSL2 serial link operates at a fixed rate of 3 Gbps
    or 6 Gbps in the forward direction and 187.5Mbps in the reverse direction. The
    MAX96724/F/R supports both aggregation and replication of video data, enabling
    streams from multiple remotely located sensors to be combined and routed to one
    or more of the available CSI-2 outputs.

    The MAX96724 DPHY Evaluation Kit (EV Kit) provides a proven design and reliable
    platform to evaluate the MAX96724 device using standard FAKRA coaxial cables.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx KV260.
