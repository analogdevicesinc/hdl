  description: >
    The DAC JESD204B/C Transport Peripheral (AD-IP-JESD204-TRANSPORT-DAC) implements
    the transport level handling of a JESD204B/C transmitter device. It is compatible
    with a wide range of Analog Devices high-speed digital-to-analog converters.

    The core handles the JESD204B/C framing of the user-provided payload data. In
    addition, it is capable of generating standard and user-defined test-pattern data
    for interface verification. It also features a per-channel dual-tone DDS that
    can be used to dynamically generate test-tones.

    The peripheral can be configured at runtime through a AXI4-Lite memory mapped
    register map.
