  description: >
    This design is meant to support the AD485x family. For example, EVAL-AD4858 board
    contains AD4858 chip, which is a 20-bit, low noise 8-channel simultaneous sampling
    successive approximation register (SAR) ADC, with buffered differential, wide
    common range picoamp inputs.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
