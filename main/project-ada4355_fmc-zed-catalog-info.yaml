  description: >
    The ADA4355/ ADA4356 is a complete, high performance, current input µModule. For
    space savings, the ADA4355/ ADA4356 includes all the required active and passive
    components to realize a complete current to bits data acquisition solution, supporting
    a small form factor, optical modules as well as multichannel systems.

    The high speed transimpedance amplifier (TIA) supports short optical pulses: 10
    ns for the ADA4355 and 20 ns for the ADA4356, enabling high spatial resolution
    in Time of Flight (ToF) measurements. Both devices provide three TIA gain (TZ)
    settings to maximize dynamic range. An internal, selectable, analog low-pass filter
    (LPF) can limit the devices bandwidth with a corner frequency of 100 MHz to minimize
    broadband noise while also serving as an antialiasing filter for the 125 MSPS
    ADC.

    The 14-bit ADC converts the amplified voltage signal at a rate of up to 125 MSPS
    and outputs the digitized signals through two serial, low voltage differential
    signaling (LVDS) data lanes, operating at rates of up to 1 Gbps per lane. The
    data clock output (DCO) operates at frequencies of up to 500 MHz and supports
    double data rate (DDR) operation.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
