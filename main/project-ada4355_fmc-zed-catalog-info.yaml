  description: >
    The ADA4355 is a complete, high performance, current input ÂµModule. For space
    savings, the ADA4355 includes all the required active and passive components to
    realize a complete current to bits data acquisition solution, supporting a small
    form factor, optical modules as well as multichannel systems.

    The high speed transimpedance amplifier (TIA) of the device supports 10 ns pulse
    widths, allowing high spatial resolution for Time of Flight (ToF) measurements.
    Additionally, the ADA4355 includes three TIA gain (TZ) settings to maximize dynamic
    range. An internal, selectable, analog low-pass filter (LPF) can limit the device
    bandwidth with a corner frequency of 100 MHz to minimize broadband noise while
    also serving as an antialiasing filter for the 125 MSPS ADC.

    The 14-bit ADC converts the amplified voltage signal at a rate of up to 125 MSPS
    and outputs the digitized signals through two serial, low voltage differential
    signaling (LVDS) data lanes, operating at rates of up to 1 Gbps per lane. The
    data clock output (DCO) operates at frequencies of up to 500 MHz and supports
    double data rate (DDR) operation.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
