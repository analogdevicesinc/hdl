    The EVAL-AD7768FMCZ / EVAL-AD7768-4FMCZ evaluation kit features the AD7768 / AD7768-4
    24-bit, 256 kSPS, analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A 7 V to 9 V external bench
    top supply is regulated to 5 V and 3.3 V to supply the AD7768 / AD7768-4 and support
    components. The AD7768 / AD7768-4 are 8-channel and 4-channel simultaneous sampling
    sigma-delta (Σ-Δ) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), respectively, with a Σ-Δ
    modulator and digital filter per channel, enabling synchronized sampling of ac
    and dc signals. The AD7768 / AD7768-4 achieve 108 dB dynamic range at a maximum
    input bandwidth of 110.8 kHz, combined with typical performance of ±2 ppm integral
    nonlinearity (INL), ±50 μV offset error, and ±30 ppm gain error.

    The AD7768 / AD7768-4 user can trade off input bandwidth, output data rate, and
    power dissipation, and select one of three power modes to optimize for noise targets
    and power consumption. The flexibility of the AD7768 / AD7768-4 allows it to become
    a reusable platform for low power dc and high performance ac measurement module.
    The AD7768 / AD7768-4 has three modes: fast mode (256 kSPS maximum, 110.8 kHz
    input bandwidth, 51.5 mW per channel), median mode (128 kSPS maximum, 55.4 kHz
    input bandwidth, 27.5 mW per channel) and low power mode (32 kSPS maximum, 13.8
    kHz input bandwidth, 9.375 mW per channel). The AD7768 / AD7768-4 offers extensive
    digital filtering capabilities, such as a wideband, low ±0.005 dB pass-band ripple,
    antialiasing low-pass filter with sharp roll-off, and 105 dB attenuation at the
    Nyquist frequency. Frequency domain measurements can use the wideband linear phase
    filter. This filter has a flat pass band (±0.005 dB ripple) from dc to 102.4 kHz
    at 256 kSPS, from dc to 51.2 kHz at 128 kSPS, or from dc to 12.8 kHz at 32 kSPS.

    The AD7768 / AD7768-4 also offers sinc response via a sinc5 filter, a low latency
    path for low bandwidth, and low noise measurements. The wideband and sinc5 filters
    can be selected and run on a per channel basis. Within these filter options, the
    user can improve the dynamic range by selecting from decimation rates of ×32,
    ×64, ×128, ×256, ×512, and ×1024. The ability to vary the decimation filtering
    optimizes noise performance to the required input bandwidth. Embedded analog functionality
    on each ADC channel makes design easier, such as a precharge buffer on each analog
    input that reduces analog input current and a precharge reference buffer per channel
    reduces input current and glitches on the reference input terminals.

    The device operates with a 5 V AVDD1A and AVDD1B supply, a 2.25 V to 5.0 V AVDD2A
    and AVDD2B supply, and a 2.5 V to 3.3 V or 1.8 V IOVDD supply (see the 1.8 V IOVDD
    Operation section for specific requirements for operating at 1.8 V IOVDD). The
    device requires an external reference; the absolute input reference voltage range
    is 1 V to AVDD1 − AVSS. The specified operating temperature range is −40°C to
    +105°C. The device is housed in a 10 mm × 10 mm 64-lead LQFP package with a 12
    mm × 12 mm printed circuit board (PCB) footprint.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
