  description: >
    The DAQ3 reference design showcases the EVAL-FMCDAQ3-EBZ evaluation board, which
    is comprised of the AD9680 dual, 14-bit, 1.25 GSPS, JESD204B (subclass 1) ADC,
    the AD9152 dual, 16-bit, 2.5 GSPS, JESD204B (subclass 1) DAC, and the AD9528 JESD204B/C
    clock generator, and some power management components. It is clocked by an internally
    generated carrier platform via the FMC connector, comprising a completely self
    contained data acquisition and signal synthesis prototyping platform.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCU118.
