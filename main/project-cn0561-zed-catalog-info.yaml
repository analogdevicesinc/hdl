  description: >
    The AD4134 is a quad channel, low noise, simultaneous sampling, precision analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC), based on the continuous time sigma-delta (CTSD) modulation scheme.
    This architecture inherently rejects signals around the ADC aliasing frequency
    band, giving the device its inherent antialiasing capability, and removesthe need
    for a complex external antialiasing filter.

    This device has four independent converter channels in parallel, each with a CTSD
    modulator and a digital decimation and filtering path. It enables simultaneous
    sampling of four signal sources, with a maximum input bandwidth of 391.5 kHz.
    It supports a wide range of ODR frequencies, from 0.01 kSPS to 1496 kSPS wih less
    than 0.01 SPS adjustment resolution, allowing the user to granularly vary sampling
    speed to achieve coherent sampling.

    The AD4134 supports two device configuration schemes: serial peripheral interface
    (SPI) and hardware pin configuration (pin control mode). The SPI control mode
    offers access to all the features and configuration options available on the chip.
    Pin control mode offers the benefit of simplifying the device configuration, enabling
    the device to operate autonomously after power-up operating in a standalone mode.

    The HDL reference design for the EVAL-CN0561 provides all the interfaces that
    are necessary to interact with the device using a Xilinx FPGA development board;
    to acquire data from the ADC device, supporting continuous data capture at maximum
    1.5 MSPS data rate. However, due to a hardware limitation, the Cora Z7S variant
    will only support a maximum data clock of 24MHz, in contrast with 50MHz supported
    on the Zedboard.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
