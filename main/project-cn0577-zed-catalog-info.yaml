  description: >
    The CN0577 provides an analog front-end and an FMC digital interface for LTC2387-18,
    its core. It is a low noise, high speed successive approximation register (SAR)
    ADC with a resolution of 18 bits and sampling rate up to 15MSPS.

    CN0577 includes an on-board reference oscillator and a retiming circuit to minimize
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation due to the FPGA additive jitter.

    In order to support high speed operations while minimizing the number of data
    lines, a serial LVDS digital interface is used. It has a one-lane and two-lane
    output modes, allowing the user to optimize the interface data rate for each application,
    through setting a parameter.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
