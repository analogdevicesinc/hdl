  title: AXI AD9783 HDL IP core
  description: >
    The AXI AD9783 IP core can be used to interface the AD9783 device. It is a dual
    DAC with 16 bits resolution, interfaced through LVDS, and with sample rates up
    to 500 MSPS. This documentation only covers the IP core and requires that one
    must be familiar with the device for a complete and better understanding.

    More about the generic framework interfacing DACs can be read in axi_dac.
