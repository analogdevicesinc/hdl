  title: ADRV904X_ZCU102 HDL project
  description: >
    The ADRV904x is a highly integrated, system on chip (SoC) radio frequency (RF)
    agile transceiver with integrated digital front end (DFE). The SoC contains eight
    transmitters, two observation receivers for monitoring transmitter channels, eight
    receivers, integrated LO and clock synthesizers, and digital signal processing
    functions. The SoC meets the high radio performance and low power consumption
    demanded by cellular infrastructure applications including small cell basestation
    radios, macro 3G/4G/5G systems, and massive MIMO base stations.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
