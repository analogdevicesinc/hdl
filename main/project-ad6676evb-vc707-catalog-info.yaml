  description: >
    The AD6676-EBZ supports the AD6676 highly integrated IF subsystem that can digitize
    radio frequency (RF) bands up to 160 MHz in width centered on an intermediate
    frequency (IF) of 70 MHz to 450 MHz.

    Unlike traditional Nyquist IF sampling ADCs, the AD6676 relies on a tunable band-pass
    Σ-Δ ADC with a high oversampling ratio to eliminate the need for band specific
    IF SAW filters and gain stages, resulting in significant simplification of the
    wideband radio receiver architecture.

    On-chip quadrature digital downconversion followed by selectable decimation filters
    reduces the complex data rate to a manageable rate between 62.5 MSPS to 266.7
    MSPS. The 16-bit complex output data is transferred to the host via a single or
    dual lane JESD204B interface supporting lane rates up to 5.333 Gbps.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VC707.
