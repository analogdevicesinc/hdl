  description: >
    The EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ is a dual channel colorimeter featuring a modulated light
    source transmitter, programmable gain transimpedance amplifiers on each channel,
    and a very low noise, 24-bit sigma delta ADC. The output of the ADC connects via
    a standard PMOD connector to a FPGA. The FPGA takes the sampled data from the
    ADC and implements a synchronous detection algorithm. By using modulated light
    and digital synchronous detection, rather than a constant (dc) source, the system
    strongly rejects any noise sources at frequencies other than the modulation frequency,
    providing excellent accuracy.

    The dual channel circuit measures the ratio of light absorbed by the liquids in
    the sample and reference containers at three different wavelengths. This forms
    the basis of many chemical analysis and environmental monitoring instruments used
    to measure concentrations and characterize materials through absorption spectroscopy.

    The EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ HDL reference design is based on the Analog Devices base
    reference design for the ZED board. In addition to the base reference design EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ
    HDL reference design implements function blocks to communicate over a SPI bus
    with the AD7175-2 Sigma-Delta ADC to configure it and receive the raw ADC data
    as well a configure the AD5201 digital potentiometer. The data received from the
    ADC is passed to a processing pipeline which performs a digital synchronous detector
    and finally write the data to system memory using a DMA. The HDL reference design
    is also responsible for generating the LED excitation signal. A simplified functional
    block diagram of the system is given below.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
