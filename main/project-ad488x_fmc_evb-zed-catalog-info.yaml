  description: >
    The EVAL-AD4880-FMC is designed to demonstrate the AD4880 performance.

    The AD488X-FMC-EVB HDL project supports the following AD4880 features:

    - Single/Dual lane DDR data capture

    - Self synchronization using the fixed pattern and bit-slip feature

    - Capturing digital averaging filter with up to 2^10 decimation

    - Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) configuration via serial peripheral interface
    (SPI)

    - Sampling rate capability between 1.25 MSPS and 40 MSPS

    - Synchronized capture between the channels

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
