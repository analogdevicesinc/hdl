  description: >
    The Data Offload Engine is, in essence, a clock-domain crossing store-and-forward
    buffer (or FIFO) with some extra features useful in bursty RF applications. More
    specifically, it was designed to sit between the DMA and the DAC for the TX and
    between the ADC and the DMA for the RX path of a digital RF chain. This is reflected
    in the synthesis settings of the device, that also enable or disable certain other
    settings of features where appropriate. For example, in the receive path cyclic
    operation isn't supported.
