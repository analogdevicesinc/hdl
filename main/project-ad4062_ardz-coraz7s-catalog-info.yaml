  title: AD4062-ARDZ HDL project
  description: >
    The HDL reference design for the AD4060, AD4062. They are versatile, 16-bit/12-bit,
    successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that
    enable low-power, high-density data acquisition solutions without sacrificing
    precision. These ADCs offer a unique balance of performance and power efficiency,
    plus innovative features for seamlessly switching between high-resolution and
    low-power modes tailored to the immediate needs of the system.

    The AD4060/AD4062 evaluation boards enable quick and easy evaluation of the performance
    and features of the AD4060 or the AD4062, respectively.

    This project has an i3c_controller instance to control and acquire data from the
    precision ADC.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx CORAZ7S.
