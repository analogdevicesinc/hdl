  description: >
    The AD469X HDL reference design provides all the interfaces that are necessary
    to interact with the devices on the EVAL-AD4696 board.

    The design has a SPI Engine instance to control and acquire data from the AD4696
    16-bit precisions ADC, providing support to capture continuous samples at maximum
    sampling rate. Currently the design supports the Zedboard.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
