  title: AD9083-EVB HDL Project
  description: >
    The AD9083_EVB reference design is a processor-based embedded system. The design
    consists of a receive chain; the receive chain transports the captured samples
    from ADC to the system memory (DDR). The AD9083-EVB evaluation board includes
    all the support circuitry required to operate the AD9083 in various modes and
    configurations.

    The AD9083 is a 16-bit, 16 channel with 125 MHz bandwidth per channel (2 GSPS
    total) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring an on-chip programmable, single-pole
    antialiasing filter and termination resistor that is designed for low power, small
    size, and ease of use. The digital outputs are designed to use the JESD204B standard,
    in subclass 1 or 0. The current HDL design supports only subclass 1 operations.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
