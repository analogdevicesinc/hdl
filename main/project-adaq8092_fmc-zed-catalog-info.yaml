  description: >
    The EVAL-ADAQ8092 evaluates the ADAQ8092, a 14-bit, 105MSPS , high-speed dual-channel
    data acquisition uModule solution. This device uses the System-in-Package (SiP)
    that integrates three common signal processing and conditioning blocks.

    This EVAL-ADAQ8092 board does not need an external power supply to operate and
    requires a very small jitter in the clock source. We recommend to use the DC1075B
    to improve the clock signal source. For full details on the ADAQ8092, see the
    ADAQ8092 data sheet, which must be consulted in conjunction with this user guide
    when using the EVAL-ADAQ8092.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
