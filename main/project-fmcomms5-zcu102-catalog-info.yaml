  title: FMCOMMS5 HDL Project
  description: >
    The FMCOMMS5 is a high-speed analog module designed to showcase the AD9361 in
    multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) applications. The AD9361 is a high performance,
    highly integrated RF transceiver that operates from 70 MHz to 6 GHz, and supports
    bandwidths from less than 200 kHz to 56 MHz. The FMCOMMS5 supports dual AD9361
    devices, allowing for the creation of a 4x4 MIMO system. This platform is intended
    to enable the prototyping and development of many software defined radio applications.

    The AD9361 consists of 2 receive and 2 transmit paths (2 Rx, 2 Tx).

    The only difference between AD9361 and AD9364 (1 Rx, 1 Tx) is the number of channels.
    Software, HDL, pinout, etc - is all the same.

    The digital interface consists of 12 bits of DDR data and supports full duplex
    operation in all configurations up to 4x4. The transmit and receive data paths
    share a single clock. The data is sent or received based on the configuration
    (programmable) from separate transmit and to separate receive chains.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
