  title: CN0506 HDL project
  description: >
    The CN0506 is a dual channel, low latency, low power Ethernet PHY card supporting
    speeds of 10/100/1000 Mbps for Industrial Ethernet applications. The circuit consists
    of two indivudual, independent 10/100/1000Mb ADIN1300 PHYs, each with an energy
    efficient Ethernet (EEE) physical layer device (PHY) core with all associated
    common analog circuitry, input and output clock buffering, management interface,
    subsystem registers, MAC interface and control logic.

    The design is powered from the host field programmable gate array (FPGA) mezzanine
    card (FMC) development board, eliminating the need for an external power supply.
    A software programmable clock enables media independent interface (MII), reduced
    MII (RMII), and reduced Gigabit MII (RGMII) MAC interface modes. RJ45 ports with
    integrated magnetics keep the solution as compact as possible. The solution supports
    cable lengths up to 150 meters at gigabit speeds and up to 180 meters at 100 Mbps
    or 10 Mbps.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZC706.
