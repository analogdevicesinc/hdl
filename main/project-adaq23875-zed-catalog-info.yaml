  description: >
    The EVAL-ADAQ23875/ EVAL-ADAQ23876/ EVAL-ADAQ23878 provide an analog front-end
    and an FMC digital interface for ADAQ23875/ ADAQ23876/ ADAQ23878, its core. It
    is a low noise, high speed successive approximation register (SAR) ADC with a
    resolution of 18/16 bits and sampling rate up to 15MSPS.

    The ADAQ2387x family includes an on-board reference oscillator and a retiming
    circuit to minimize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation due to the FPGA additive
    jitter.

    In order to support high speed operations while minimizing the number of data
    lines, a serial LVDS digital interface is used. It has a one-lane and two-lane
    output modes, allowing the user to optimize the interface data rate for each application,
    through setting a parameter.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
