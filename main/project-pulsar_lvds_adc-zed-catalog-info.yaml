  description: >
    The AD7625, AD7626, AD7960, AD7961 devices are parts from ADC LVDS PulSAR family.
    The AD7625 / AD7626 is a 16-bit, 6 MSPS / 10 MSPS, charge redistribution successive
    approximation register (SAR) architecture, analog to-digital converter (ADC).
    SAR architecture allows unmatched performance both in noise (92dB SNR) and in
    linearity (±1 LSB INL / ±0.45 LSB INL). The AD7626 contains a high speed 16-bit
    sampling ADC, an internal conversion clock, and an internal buffered reference.
    On the CNV edge, it samples the voltage difference between IN+ and IN- pins. The
    voltages on these pins swing in opposite phase between 0 V and REF.

    The 4.096V reference voltage, REF, can be generated internally or applied externally.
    All converted results are available on a single LVDS self-clocked or echoed-clock
    serial interface reducing external hardware connections. The AD7625 / AD7626 is
    available in a 32-lead LFCSP (5mm by 5mm) with operation specified from -40°C
    to +85°C.

    The AD7960 / AD7961 is an 18-bit/16-bit, 5 MSPS, charge redistribution successive
    approximation (SAR), analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The SAR architecture allows
    unmatched performance both in noise and in linearity. The AD7960 / AD7961 contains
    a low power, high speed, 18-bit/16-bit sampling ADC, an internal conversion clock,
    and an internal reference buffer.

    On the CNV± edge, the AD7960 / AD7961 samples the voltage difference between the
    IN+ and IN− pins. The voltages on these pins swing in opposite phase between 0
    V and 4.096 V and between 0 V and 5 V. The reference voltage is applied to the
    part externally. All conversion results are available on a single LVDS self clocked
    or echoed clock serial interface. The AD7960 is available in a 32-lead LFCSP (QFN)
    with operation specified from −40°C to +85°C.
