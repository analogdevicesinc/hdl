  description: >
    The AD9265 is a 16-bit, 125 MSPS analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The AD9265
    is designed to support communications applications where high performance combined
    with low cost, small size, and versatility is desired. The ADC core features a
    multistage, differential pipelined architecture with integrated output error correction
    logic to provide 16-bit accuracy at 125 MSPS data rates and guarantees no missing
    codes over the full operating temperature range. The ADC output data format is
    either parallel 1.8 V CMOS or LVDS (DDR). A data output clock is provided to ensure
    proper latch timing with receiving logic. The board also provides other options
    to drive the clock and analog inputs of the ADC.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
