  title: AD9739A-FMC HDL project
  description: >
    The AD9739A is a 14-bit, 2.5 GSPS high performance RF DAC capable of synthesizing
    wideband signals with up to 1.25GHz of bandwidth, from DC up to 3 GHz.

    This reference design includes a single tone sine generator (DDS) and allows programming
    the device and monitoring its internal status registers. It also programs the
    ADF4350 clock chip which can generate a 1.6G Hz to 2.5 GHz clock for the AD9739A
    from the on-board 25MHz crystal. An alternate clock path using an ADCLK914 is
    available for driving the clock externally.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZC706.
