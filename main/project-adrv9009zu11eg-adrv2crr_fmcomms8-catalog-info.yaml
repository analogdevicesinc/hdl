  title: FMCOMMS8_ADRV9009ZU11EG HDL project
  description: >
    The HDL reference design is built around the Zynq® Ultrascale+ four Cortex™-A536
    MPCore processors. A functional block diagram of the system is shown below.

    The PS8 provides a SDIO, UART, Ethernet, SPI, USB 3.0, QSPI and a Display Port
    control modules.

    The two ADRV9009's digital interface is handled by the JESD20B physical, data
    link and transport layer IPs. The JESD204B lanes are shared among the 8 transmit,
    4 receive and 4 observation/sniffer receive data paths by the same set of transceivers
    within the IP. The cores are programmable through an AXI-lite interface.

    There are 2 PL DDR4 32 bit @1200MHz which can be used as OFFLOAD FIFOs in the
    system.

    There are additional transceiver lanes available that can be used to implement
    PCIe Gen3 x8, 10Gb ethernet and 40Gb ethernet at the same time. On top of those,
    another 10 transceiver lanes can be used to implement a full FMC HPC connector,
    through which to extend the system with another two ADRV9009s.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ADRV2CRR_FMCOMMS8.
