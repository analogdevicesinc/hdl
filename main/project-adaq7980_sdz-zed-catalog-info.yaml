  description: >
    The ADAQ7980/ADAQ7988 are 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) subsystems
    that integrate four common signal processing and conditioning blocks into a system
    in package (SiP) design that supports a variety of applications. These devices
    contain the most critical passive components, eliminating many of the design challenges
    associated with traditional signal chains that use successive approximation register
    (SAR) ADCs. These passive components are crucial to achieving the specified device
    performance.

    The ADAQ7980/ADAQ7988 contain a high accuracy, low power, 16-bit SAR ADC, a low
    power, high bandwidth, high input impedance ADC driver, a low power, stable reference
    buffer, and an efficient power management block. Housed within a tiny, 5 mm ×
    4 mm LGA package, these systems simplify the design process for data acquisition
    systems. The level of system integration of the ADAQ7980/ADAQ7988 solves many
    design challenges, while the devices still provide the flexibility of a configurable
    ADC driver feedback loop to allow gain and/or common-mode adjustments. A set of
    four device supplies provides optimal system performance; however, single-supply
    operation is possible with minimal impact on device operating specifications.

    Using the SDI input, the SPI-compatible serial interface features the ability
    to daisy-chain multiple devices on a single, 3-wire bus and provides an optional
    busy indicator. The user interface is compatible with 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3 V, or 5
    V logic. Specified operation of these devices is from −55°C to +125°C.

    Applications:

    - Automated test equipment (ATE)

    - Battery powered instrumentation

    - Communications

    - Data acquisition

    - Process control

    - Medical instruments

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
