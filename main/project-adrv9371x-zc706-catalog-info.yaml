  title: ADRV9371X_ZC706 HDL project
  description: >
    The ADRV371x HDL reference design is an embedded system built around a processor
    core either ARM, NIOS-II or MicroBlaze. The device digital interface is handled
    by the transceiver IP followed by the JESD204B and device specific cores. The
    JESD204B lanes are shared among the 4 transmit, 4 receive and 2 observation/sniffer
    receive data paths by the same set of transceivers within the IP. The cores are
    programmable through an AXI-lite interface. The delineated data is then passed
    on to independent DMA cores for the transmit, receive and observation/sniffer
    paths.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZC706.
