  title: AXI_SYSID HDL IP core
  description: >
    The System ID solution is comprised of 2 IP cores: the AXI System ID which provides
    the AXI Lite interface and System ID ROM which acts as a ROM and contains the
    data. Together, they provide the user with information regarding the conditions
    in which the hardware system was built. The System ID information is used to provide
    information about the systemâ€™s bit file, to facilitate future debugging actions.
    This information will be stored internally in a ROM and will be made available
    to the system via the AXI Lite interface.
