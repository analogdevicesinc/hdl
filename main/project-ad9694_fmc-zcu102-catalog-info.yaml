  description: >
    The AD9694-500EBZ supports the AD9694, a quad, 14-bit, 500 MSPS ADC. The device
    has an on-chip buffer and a sample-and-hold circuit designed for low power, small
    size, and ease of use. This device is designed for sampling wide bandwidth analog
    signals of up to 1.4 GHz. The AD9694 is optimized for wide input bandwidth, high
    sampling rate, excellent linearity, and low power in a small package.

    Product highlights:

    - Low power consumption per channel

    - JESD204B lane rate support up to 15 Gbps

    - Wide full power bandwidth supports IF sampling of signals up to 1.4 GHz

    - Buffered inputs ease filter design and implementation

    - Four integrated wideband decimation filters and NCO blocks supporting multiband
    receivers

    - Programmable fast overrange detection

    - On-chip temperature diode for system thermal management

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
