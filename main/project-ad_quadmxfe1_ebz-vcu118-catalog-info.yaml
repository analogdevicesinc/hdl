  title: AD-QUADMXFE1-EBZ HDL project
  description: >
    The AD-QUADMXFE1-EBZ reference design is a processor based (e.g. Microblaze) embedded
    system, which showcases the QUAD-MXFE evaluation board.

    The Quad-MxFE System Development Platform contains four MxFE (Mixed-signal Front
    End) software defined, direct RF sampling transceivers, as well as associated
    RF front-ends, clocking, and power circuitry. The target application is phased
    array radars, electronic warfare, and ground-based SATCOM, specifically a 16 transmit/16
    receive channel direct sampling phased array at L/S/C band (0.1 GHz to ~5GHz).

    - 16x RF receive (RX) channels (32x digital RX channels), with 16 ADCs going from
    1.5 GSPS to 4 GSPS, and 48x Digital Down Converters (DDCs), each including complex
    Numerically-Controlled Oscillators (NCOs)

    - 16x RF transmit (TX) channels (32x digital TX channels), with 16 DACs going
    from 3 GSPS to 12 GSPS, and 48x Digital Up Converters (DUCs), each including complex
    Numerically-Controlled Oscillators (NCOs)

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCU118.
