  title: ADRV9009_ZCU102 HDL project
  description: >
    The HDL reference design is an embedded system built around a processor core either
    ARM, NIOS-II or Microblaze. A functional block diagram of the system is shown
    below. The device digital interface is handled by the transceiver IP followed
    by the JESD204B and device specific cores. The JESD204B lanes are shared among
    the 4 transmit, 2 receive and 2 observation/sniffer receive data paths by the
    same set of transceivers within the IP. The cores are programmable through an
    AXI-lite interface. The delineated data is then passed on to independent DMA cores
    for the transmit, receive and observation/sniffer paths.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
