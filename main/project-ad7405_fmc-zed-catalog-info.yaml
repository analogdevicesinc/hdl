  description: >
    The EVAL-AD7405 is a full-featured evaluation board designed to allow the user
    to easily evaluate all features of the AD7405 isolated analog-to-digital converter
    (ADC).

    The provided HDL reference design supports the AD7405, AD7403 and ADuM7701 devices.
    One of the main differences between these devices is the type of the digital data
    lines. In the case of ADuM7701 and AD7403, it is single-ended, and for AD7405
    is differential.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
