  description: >
    The AXI AD9963 IP core can be used to interface the AD9963 chip. It features a
    dual 12-bit ADC working up to 100MSPS and a dual 12-bit DAC with up to 170MSPS.
    It also features a DLL which can provide clock for both the ADC and the DAC path.

    More about the generic framework interfacing ADCs can be read in axi_adc and interfacing
    DACs in axi_dac.
