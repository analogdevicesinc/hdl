  description: >
    The AD9656 is a quad 16-bit, 125 MSPS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring
    an on-chip sample and hold circuit. It is designed to be low cost, low power and
    compact, making it easy to use.

    AD9656 operates at a conversion rate of up to 125 MSPS, optimized for excellent
    dynamic performance and low power consumption, which is crucial for applications
    requiring a small package size. It requires a single 1.8 V power supply and supports
    LVPECL, CMOS, and LVDS-compatible sample rate clocks for full performance. The
    ADC does not need external reference or driver components for many applications.
    It also includes features to enhance flexibility and reduce system costs, such
    as a programmable output clock, data alignment and digital test pattern generation.

    An on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) allows users to provide a single ADC sampling
    clock. The PLL multiplies the ADC sampling clock to produce the corresponding
    JESD204B data rate clock. The configurable JESD204B output block supports up to
    8.0 Gbps per lane. JESD204B output block supports one, two, and four lane configurations.
    The SPI control offers a wide range of flexible features to meet specific system
    requirements

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
