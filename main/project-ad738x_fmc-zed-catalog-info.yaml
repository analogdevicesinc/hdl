    The AD7380/ AD7381 are a 16-bit and 14-bit pin-compatible family of dual simultaneous
    sampling, high speed, low power, successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs) that operate from a 3.3 V power supply and feature throughput
    rates up to 4 MSPS.The analog input type is differential for the AD7380, AD7381,
    AD4680, AD4681, AD7380-4, AD7389-4, AD7381-4 can accepts a wide common-mode input
    voltage, and is sampled and converted on the falling edge of CS.

    The AD7383, AD7384, AD4682 and AD4683 have the pseudo-differential input while
    the AD7386, AD7387, AD7388, AD4684 and AD4685 have single-ended input. The AD7380
    family has optional integrated on-chip oversampling blocks to improve dynamic
    range and reduce noise at lower bandwidths. An internal 2.5 V reference is included.
    Alternatively, an external reference up to 3.3 V can be used.

    The conversion process and data acquisition use standard control inputs allowing
    for easy interfacing to microprocessors or DSPs. It is compatible with 1.8 V,
    2.5 V, and 3.3 V interfaces, using a separate logic supply.

    The dual AD7380, AD7381, AD4680, AD4681, AD7383, AD7384, AD4682, AD4683, AD7386,
    AD7387, AD7388, AD4684 and AD4685 family are available in a 16-lead 3mm x 3mm
    LFCSP package while the quad generics AD7380-4, AD7389-4, and AD7381-4 are available
    in 4mmx4mm LFCSP package. Both the duals and quad generic operate in specified
    from -40°C to +125°C temperature range.

    Applications:

    - Motor control position feedback

    - Motor control current sense

    - Data acquisition system

    - EDFA applications

    - I and Q demodulation

    - SONAR

    - Power Quality

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
