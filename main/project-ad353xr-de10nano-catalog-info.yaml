  description: >
    The AD3530R/ AD3530 and AD3531R/ AD3531 are low power, 16-bit, buffered voltage
    output, digital-to-analog converters (DACs) that include a gain bit field, resulting
    in a full-scale output of 2.5V (gain = 1) or 5V (gain = 2) for a reference voltage
    of 2.5V. AD3530/ AD3530R has 8 channels, and AD3531/ AD3531R has 4 channels. AD3530R
    and AD3531R has an on-chip, buffered, 2.5V reference available at the VREF pin,
    capable of sourcing external loads up to +5mA.

    Each DAC channel has its own Input register and DAC register. The DAC Register
    stores digital code equivalent to the DAC output voltage while the Input Register
    acts as a temporary staging register before being passed on the DAC Register.
    With the LDAC function, one or more DAC registers could be updated in parallel
    with the data held in the Input Register. The DAC registers can also be directly
    written to, in which the corresponding output updates immediately without an LDAC.

    AD3530R/ AD3530 contains eight buffered voltage output DAC channels capable of
    sourcing 50mA and sinking up to 40mA of current. AD3531R/ AD3531 contains four
    buffered voltage output DAC channels capable of sourcing 100mA and sinking 80
    mA of current.

    The AD3530R/ AD3530 contains a 27:1 multiplexer while AD3531R/ AD3531 contains
    a 15:1 multiplexer, in which both could output a voltage on the MUX_OUT pin that
    is a representative of either the output voltage or output current of a chosen
    channel, or the internal die temperature of the device.

    Applications:

    - Optical transceivers

    - Test and measurement

    - Industrial automation

    - Data acquisition systems

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
