  description: >
    The AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ module is comprised of the AD9680 dual, 14-bit, 1.0 GSPS, JESD204B
    ADC, the AD9144 quad, 16-bit, 2.8 GSPS, JESD204B DAC, the AD9523-1 clock, and
    power management components. It is clocked by an internally generated carrier
    platform via the FMC connector, comprising a completely self contained data acquisition
    and signal synthesis prototyping platform. In an FMC footprint, the module's combination
    of wideband data conversion, clocking, and power closely approximates real-world
    hardware and software for system prototyping and design, with no compromise in
    signal chain performance.

    The HDL reference design is an embedded system built around a processor core either
    ARM, NIOS-II or Microblaze. The high speed digital interface of the converters
    is handled by the JESD204B framework.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx KC705.
