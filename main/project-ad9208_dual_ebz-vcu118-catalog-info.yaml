  description: >
    The AD9208-DUAL-EBZ evaluation board features the AD9208 dual, 14-bit, 3 GSPS
    ADC.

    The reference design is a processor-based (e.g. Microblaze) embedded system. The
    device interfaces to the FPGA transceivers followed by the individual JESD204B
    and ADC cores. The cores are programmable through an AXI-Lite interface. The samples
    are passed to the system memory (DDR).

    The device has an on-chip buffer and a sample-andhold circuit designed for low
    power, small size, and ease of use. This product is designed to support communications
    applications capable of direct sampling wide bandwidth analog signals of up to
    5 GHz. The -3 dB bandwidth of the ADC input is 9 GHz.

    The AD9208 is optimized for wide input bandwidth, high sampling rate, excellent
    linearity, and low power in a small package. The dual ADC cores feature a multistage,
    differential pipelined architecture with integrated output error correction logic.
    Each ADC features wide bandwidth inputs supporting a variety of user-selectable
    input ranges.

    The user can configure the Subclasss 1 JESD204B-based high-speed serialized output
    in a variety of 1-lane, 2-lane, 4-lane, and 8-lane configurations, depending on
    the DDC configuration and the acceptable lane rate of the receiving logic device.
    Multidevice synchronization is supported through the SYSREF± and SYNCINB± input
    pins. The AD9208 has flexible power-down options that allow significant power
    savings when desired. All of these features can be programmed using a 3-wire serial
    port interface (SPI).

    Features:

    - Up to 4 channels available

    - JESD204B (Subclass 1) coded serial digital outputs

    - 2 integrated, wideband digital processors per channel

    - Phase coherent NCO switching

    - 9 GHz analog input full power bandwidth (-3 dB)

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCU118.
