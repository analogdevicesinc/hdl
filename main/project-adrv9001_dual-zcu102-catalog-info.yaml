  title: ADRV9001_DUAL_ZCU102 HDL project
  description: >
    This design allows controlling, receiving and transmitting sample stream from/to
    two ADRV9001/ADRV9002 devices(2x eval b) through four independent source synchronous
    interfaces for each direction and for each device. Supports both CMOS and LVDS
    interface, but not in the same time. The selection of the I/O standard must be
    done with a parameter during build.

    The design supports SDR or DDR modes in CMOS mode with one of four lanes, as in
    LVDS mode one or two lane mode. This is runtime selectable. The complete list
    of supported modes can be consulted in the axi_adrv9001 Interface Core documentation.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
