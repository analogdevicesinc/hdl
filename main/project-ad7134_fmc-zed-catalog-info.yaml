  title: AD7134-FMC HDL project
  description: >
    The AD7134 is a quad channel, low noise, simultaneous sampling, precision analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC), based on the continuous time sigma-delta (CTSD) modulation scheme.
    The CTSD architecture inherently rejects signals around the ADC aliasing frequency
    band, giving the device its inherent antialiasing capability, and removes the
    need for a complex external antialiasing filter.

    The device has four independent converter channels in parallel, each with a CTSD
    modulator and a digital decimation and filtering path. The bandwidth of each ADC
    channel ranges from dc to 391.5 kHz, making the device an ideal candidate for
    universal precision data acquisition solutions supporting a breadth of sensor
    types, from temperature and pressure to vibration and shock.

    It supports a wide range of ODR frequencies, from 0.01 kSPS to 1496 kSPS with
    less than 0.01 SPS adjustment resolution, allowing the user to granularly vary
    sampling speed to achieve coherent sampling. The adc offers three main digital
    filter profile options: a wideband low ripple filter (2.5 kSPS to 374 kSPS), a
    fast responding sinc3 filter (0.01 kSPS to 1496 kSPS), and a balanced sinc6 filter
    with an ODR range 2.5 kSPS to 1.496 MSPS.
     The AD7134 supports two device configuration schemes: serial peripheral interface
    (SPI) and hardware pin configuration (pin control mode). The SPI control mode
    offers access to all the features and configuration options available on the chip.
    Pin control mode offers the benefit of simplifying the device configuration, enabling
    the device to operate autonomously after power -up operating in a standalone mode.
    In addition to the optional SPI, it has a flexible and independent data interface
    for transmitting the ADC output data.
    The EVAL-AD7134FMCZ evaluation kit features the AD7134 24-bit, 4-channel, simultaneous
    sampling adc. Two on-board AD7134 ADCs are included to demonstrate multidevice
    simultaneous sampling. The HDL reference design provides all the interfaces necessary
    to interact with the device using a Xilinx FPGA development board.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
