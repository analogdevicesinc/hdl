  title: SPI_ENGINE_INTERCONNECT HDL IP core
  description: >
    The SPI Engine Interconnect allows connecting multiple spi_engine control-interface
    managers to a single spi_engine control-interface subordinate. This enables multiple
    command stream generators to connect to a single spi_engine execution and consequential
    give them access to the same SPI bus. The interconnect modules take care of properly
    arbitrating between the different command streams.

    Combining multiple command stream generators in a design and connecting them to
    a single execution module allows for the creation of flexible and efficient designs
    using standard components.
