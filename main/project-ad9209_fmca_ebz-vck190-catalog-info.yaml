  title: AD9209-FMCA-EBZ HDL project
  description: >
    The AD9209-FMCA-EBZ reference design is a processor-based embedded system. This
    reference design works with AD9081-FMCA-EBZ (RX only) / AD9082-FMCA-EBZ (RX only)
    / EVAL-AD9986 (RX only) / EVAL-AD9988 (RX only).

    This design consists of one receive chain. Thus, only the RX path would be used
    when the evaulation board is either EVAL-AD9081/AD9082/AD9986/AD9988.

    The receive chain transports the captured samples from ADC to the system memory
    (DDR). Before transferring the data to DDR the samples are stored in a buffer
    implemented on block RAMs from the FPGA fabric (util_adcfifo). The space allocated
    in the buffer for each channel depends on the number of currently active channels.
    It goes up to M x 64k samples if a single channel is selected or 64k samples per
    channel, if all channels are selected.

    All cores from the receive chain are programmable through an AXI-Lite interface.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCK190.
