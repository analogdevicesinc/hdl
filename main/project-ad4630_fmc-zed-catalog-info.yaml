  description: >
    The AD4630-24 is a two-channel, simultaneous sampling, Easy Drive, 2 MSPS successive
    approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The AD4030-24
    is the single channel version. With a guaranteed maximum ±0.9 ppm INL and no missing
    codes at 24-bits, the AD4630-24 and AD4030-24 achieve unparalleled precision from
    −40°C to +125°C. The AD4030-16 is a 16-bit dual channel version.

    A low-drift, internal precision reference buffer eases voltage reference sharing
    with other system circuitry. The AD4630-24 offers a typical dynamic range of 106
    dB when using a 5 V reference. The AD4030-24 offers a typical dynamic range of
    109 dB using a 5 V reference. The low noise floor enables signal chains requiring
    less gain and lower power. A block averaging filter with programmable decimation
    ratio can increase dynamic range up to 153 dB and 155.5dB for the AD4030. The
    wide differential input and common mode ranges allow inputs to use the full ±VREF
    range without saturating, simplifying signal conditioning requirements and system
    calibration. The improved settling of the Easy Drive analog inputs broadens the
    selection of analog front-end components compatible with the AD4630-24, AD4630-16
    and AD4030-24. Both single-ended and differential signals are supported.

    The versatile Flexi-SPI serial interface eases host processor and ADC integration.
    A wide data clocking window, multiple SDO lanes, and optional DDR data clocking
    can reduce the serial clock to 10 MHz while operating at a sample rate of 2 MSPS.
    Echo clock mode and ADC master clock mode relax the timing requirements and simplify
    the use of digital isolators.

    The AD4630-24's, AD4630-16's and AD4030-24's BGA package integrates all critical
    power supply and reference bypass capacitors, reducing the footprint and system
    component count, and lessening sensitivity to board layout.

    The ADAQ4224 is a μModule® precision data acquisition (DAQ) signal chain solution
    that reduces the development cycle of a precision measurement system by transferring
    the signal chain design challenge of component selection, optimization, and layout
    from the designer to the device. With a guaranteed maximum ±TBD ppm INL and no
    missing codes at 24 bits, the ADAQ4224 achieves unparalleled precision from −40°C
    to +85°C.

    The HDL reference design for the EVAL-AD4630_FMCZ and EVAL-AD4030_FMCZ provides
    all the interfaces that are necessary to interact with the device using a Xilinx
    FPGA development board. The design has all the necessary infrastructure to acquire
    data from the AD4630-24 24-bit dual-channel precision SAR ADC, AD4630-16 16-bit
    dual channel precision SAR ADC and AD4030-24 single channel ADC, supporting continuous
    data capture at maximum 2 MSPS data rate. The design targeted to the Zedboard,
    which is a low cost FPGA carrier board from Digilent, using a Zynq-7000 re-programmable
    SoC from Xilinx.
