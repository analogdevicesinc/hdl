  description: >
    The Asymmetric AXI Stream FIFO core is a simple FIFO (First Input First Output)
    with AXI streaming interfaces, supporting synchronous and asynchronous operation
    modes with an asymmetric data width on its salve and master interface. It can
    be used to mitigate data width differences or transfer an AXI stream to a different
    clock domain.
