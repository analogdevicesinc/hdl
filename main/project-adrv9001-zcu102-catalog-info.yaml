  title: ADRV9001_ZCU102 HDL project
  description: >
    This design allows controlling, receiving and transmitting sample stream from/to
    an ADRV9001/ADRV9002 device through two independent source-synchronous interface.
    Supports both CMOS and LVDS interface, but not at the same time. The selection
    of the I/O standard must be done by setting a parameter before building the project.

    The design supports SDR or DDR modes in CMOS mode with 1 or 4 lanes, and in LVDS
    mode with 1 or 2 lanes. This is runtime configurable.. The complete list of supported
    modes can be consulted in the axi_adrv9001 Interface Core documentation.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
