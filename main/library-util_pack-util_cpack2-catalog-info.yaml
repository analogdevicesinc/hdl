  title: UTIL_CPACK2 HDL IP core
  description: >
    The channel CPACK utility core is meant to allow one or more channels to be enabled
    by software without any padding. This allows full usage of the DMA bandwidth without
    any overhead. This core normally works with an ADC and DMA modules. The ADC interface
    is channel based (one interface per each ADC channel) and consists of enable,
    valid and data signals. The DMA interface is a single FIFO interface consisting
    of valid and data signals. The enable signals are usually controlled by software.
    The core simply packs the ADC data of the individual channels into a single data
    bus, as defined by the ADC enables.
