  description: >
    The AD9213-EVB reference design is a processor based (e.g. Microblaze) embedded
    system.

    The design implements a high-speed receive chain using JESD204B.

    The receive chain transports the captured samples from ADC to the system memory
    (DDR). Before transferring the data to DDR the samples are stored in a buffer
    implemented on block rams from the FPGA fabric (data_offload).

    All cores from the receive chain are programmable through an AXI-Lite interface.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCU118.
