  description: >
    The Corundum Ethernet Core is used by the Corundum Network Stack. This Ethernet
    Core is specific to the VCU118 FPGA board and encompasses the Ethernet physical
    layer and other auxiliary structures such as SPI and I2C that are required by
    the Corundum system. The configurations are based on Corundum NIC <https://github.com/ucsdsysnet/corundum>__
    reference designs that were adapted to suit the ADI workflow.
