  description: >
    This page documents the HDL reference design for the EVAL-AD5780ARDZ, EVAL-AD5781ARDZ
    and EVAL-AD5791ARDZ evaluation boards.

    The EVAL-AD5780ARDZ facilitates fast prototyping of the AD5780 circuit, and can
    be substituted with either the AD5760 or AD5790, which must be ordered separately.
    Similarly, the EVAL-AD5781ARDZ and EVAL-AD5791ARDZ come with the AD5781 and AD5791
    respectively.

    The AD5790, AD5791, AD5760, AD5780 and AD5781 are a family of precision, single-channel
    voltage output DACs, with resolutions from 16-bits up to 20-bits. They offer guaranteed
    monotonic operation, and low nonlinearity (down to 0.5 LSB INL and DNL)

    The evaluation boards provide an on-board -14 V and +14 V dual power supply. These
    evaluation boards also utilize external reference boards with an output voltage
    of +10 V and -10 V. The eval boards are connected to the carrier board through
    the Arduino Shield connector.

    This project has a spi_engine instance to control and acquire data from the DAC.
    This instance provides support for sending continuous samples at the maximum sample
    rate.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
