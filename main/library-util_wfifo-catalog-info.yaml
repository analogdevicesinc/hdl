  title: UTIL_WFIFO HDL IP core
  description: >
    The Util WFIFO core is designed to downscale the clock rate of the RX data path.
    There are scenarios when the device clock (interface clock) is too high (above
    200 MHz), making it a challenge to integrate any processing cores between the
    device core and CPACK/DMA, because of the small timing margins. By reducing the
    clock rate of the data path, the user can easily integrate any custom processing
    core into the design.

    To define the correct configuration, the following questions need to be answered:

    #. What is the clock rate of the device core's data interface? (dout_clk) #. What
    is the data rate of the device core's data interface? (dout_valid@dout_clk) #.
    What is the targeted clock rate of the data path (din_clk), and how we can achieve
    it, respecting the main rule of thumb: input data rate must be equal to the output
    data rate?

    If the device clock rate is equal to the device data rate, the only solution to
    downscale the clock rate is to increase the data width of the output ports of
    the FIFO. Currently the util_wfifo supports four data width ratios: 1:1/1:2/1:4/1:8.
