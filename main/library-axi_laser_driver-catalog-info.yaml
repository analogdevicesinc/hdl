  description: >
    The AXI Laser Driver IP core generates all the necessary control signals for the
    ad_fmclidar1_ebz prototyping platform, to drive the laser, switch between the
    TIA channels and synchronize all the data flow inside the FPGA. This documentation
    covers the main functionality of the IP core and its software programmable registers.
