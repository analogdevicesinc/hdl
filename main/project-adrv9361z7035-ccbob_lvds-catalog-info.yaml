  title: ADRV9361Z7035 HDL Project
  description: >
    The ADRV9361-Z7035 is built on a portfolio of highly integrated System-On-Module
    (SOMs) based on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable (AP) SoC. Starting with
    the AD9361, it is schematically & HDL similar to the fmcomms2.

    The purpose of the ADRV9361-Z7035 RF SOM is to provide an RF platform to software
    developers, system architects, product developers, etc, who want a single platform
    operating over a wide tuning range (70 MHz - 6 GHz) that is capable of being used
    for prototype, evaluation and reference design to help with production volume.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx CCBOB_LVDS.
