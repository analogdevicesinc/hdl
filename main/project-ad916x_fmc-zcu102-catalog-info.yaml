  description: >
    The AD9161 /AD9162 /AD9163 /AD9164 is a high performance, 16-bit (AD9164, AD9163,
    AD9162)/11-bit (AD9161) resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that supports
    data rates to 6 GSPS.

    The DAC core is based on a quad-switch architecture coupled with a 2x interpolator
    filter that enables an effective DAC update rate of up to 12 GSPS in some modes.
    The high dynamic range and bandwidth makes this DAC ideally suited for the most
    demanding high speed radio frequency (RF) DAC applications.

    The data interface is programmable in terms of lane speed and number of lanes
    (up to 8 jesd204 serializer/deserializer SERDES lanes) to enable application flexibility.
    A serial peripheral interface (SPI) configures the DACs and monitors the status
    of all registers.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
