  title: FMCOMMS11 HDL project
  description: >
    The HDL reference design is an embedded system built around a processor core either
    ARM, NIOS-II or Microblaze. The high speed digital interface of the converters
    is handled by the JESD204B framework. Due to the system's memory interface bandwidth
    limitation, there are intermediary buffers in the both TX and RX data paths, in
    order to save and push data using high data rates. In case of the ZC706 carrier
    board, the RX buffer depth is 1Gbyte, and TX buffer depth is 1Mbyte. This depths
    can be swapped if required.

    By default, the AD9162 is configured in complex mode with 8 lanes (see Table 16
    <https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD9161-9162.pdf>__
    in data sheet), and the AD9625 is configured in generic operation mode with 8
    lanes (see Table 16 <https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD9625.pdf>__
    in data sheet). Both JESD204 interfaces run in Subclass 0.

    Other configurations can be used too, but the user needs to make sure that all
    the parties (clock chip, converters and FPGA JESD204 IPs) of the interface are
    reconfigured accordingly.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZC706.
