  title: CN0579 HDL project
  description: >
    The CN0579 is a 4-channel, high resolution, wide bandwidth, high dynamic range,
    integrated electronics piezoelectric (IEPE)-compatible interface data acquisition
    (DAQ) system that interfaces with IC piezoelectric (ICPÂ®)/IEPE sensors. The solution
    provides flexible sensor interfacing to either piezoelectric or micro-electromechanical
    systems (MEMS) sensor with measurement capabilities that extend the frequency
    response to DC.

    The design provides four channels of full bandwidth, synchronized vibration data
    to the processor, where data analysis can be done locally or on a remote host
    over Ethernet via standard IIO framework. Large buffers of continuous data can
    be streamed and analyzed using standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques
    for system characterization and machine learning algorithms.

    It targets the Intel Altera DE10NANO.
