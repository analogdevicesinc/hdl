  title: X-Band Platform HDL project
  description: >
    The X-Band Development Platform contains one MxFE® software defined, direct RF
    sampling transceivers, X-Band to C-Band Up/Down Converter, and a X/Ku Band analog
    phased array proto-typing platform. The target application is phased array radars,
    electronic warfare, and ground-based SATCOM, specifically a X Band 32 transmit/32
    receive channel hybrid beamforming phased array radar.

    The X-Band Development Platform highlights a complete system solution. It is intended
    as a testbed for demonstrating hybrid beamforming phased array radar as well as
    the implementation of system level calibrations, beamforming algorithms, and other
    signal processing algorithms. The system is designed to mate with a ZCU102 Evaluation
    Board from Xilinx®, which features the Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC FPGA, with provided
    reference software, HDL code, and MATLAB system-level interfacing software.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
