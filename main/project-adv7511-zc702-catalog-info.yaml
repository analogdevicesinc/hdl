  description: >
    The ADV7511 is a 225 MHz High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) transmitter,
    which is ideal for home entertainment products including DVD players/recorders,
    digital set top boxes, A/V receivers, gaming consoles, and PCs.

    The digital video interface contains an HDMI 1.4- and a DVI 1.0-compatible transmitter,
    and supports all HDTV formats (including 1080p with 12-bit Deep Color). The ADV7511
    supports the HDMI 1.4-specific features, HEAC (ARC), and 3D video. In addition
    to these features, the ADV7511 supports x.v.Color™, high bit rate audio, and programmable
    AVI InfoFrames. With the inclusion of HDCP, the ADV7511 allows the secure transmission
    of protected content as specified by the HDCP 1.4 protocol.

    The ADV7511 supports both S/PDIF and 8-channel I2S audio. Its high fidelity 8-channel
    I2S can transmit either stereo or 7.1 surround audio up to 768 kHz. The S/PDIF
    can carry compressed audio including Dolby® Digital, DTS®, and THX®. Fabricated
    in an advanced CMOS process, the ADV7511 is provided in a 100-lead LQFP surface-mount
    plastic package and is specified over the 0°C to +70°C temperature range.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZC702.
