  description: >
    The AXI AD9361 IP core can be used to interface the AD9361 device. This documentation
    only covers the IP core and requires that one must be familiar with the device
    for a complete and better understanding.

    More about the generic framework interfacing ADCs can be read in axi_adc, and
    interfacing DACs in axi_dac.
