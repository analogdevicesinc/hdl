  description: >
    The AD9467 chip used on EVAL-AD9467 is a 16-bit, monolithic, IF sampling analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC) with a conversion rate of up to 250 MSPS. This reference design
    includes a data capture interface and the external DDR-DRAM interface for sample
    storage. It allows programming the device and monitoring its internal status registers.
    The board also provides other options to drive the clock and analog inputs of
    the ADC. This can be done by programming the AD9517-4 clock chip and/or setting
    up the ADL5565 differential amplifier, respectively.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx KC705.
