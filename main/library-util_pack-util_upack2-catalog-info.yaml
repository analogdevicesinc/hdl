  title: UTIL_UPACK2 HDL IP core
  description: >
    The channel UPACK utility core is meant to allow one or more channels to be enabled
    by software without any padding. This allows full usage of the DMA bandwidth without
    any overhead. This core normally works with an DAC and DMA modules. The DAC interface
    is channel based (one interface per each DAC channel) and consists of enable,
    valid and data signals. The DMA interface is a single FIFO interface consisting
    of valid and data signals. The enable signals are usually controlled by software.
    The core simply unpacks the DMA data into the individual channels as defined by
    the enables.
