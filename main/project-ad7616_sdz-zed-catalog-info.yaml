  title: AD7616-SDZ HDL project
  description: >
    The AD7616 is a 16-bit, data acquisition system (DAS) that supports dual simultaneous
    sampling of 16 channels. It operates from a single 5 V supply and can accommodate
    ±10 V, ±5 V, and ±2.5 V true bipolar input signals while sampling at throughput
    rates up to 1 MSPS per channel pair with 90 dB SNR. Higher SNR performance can
    be achieved with the on-chip oversampling mode; 92 dB for an oversampling ratio
    of 2.

    The input clamp protection circuitry can tolerate voltages up to ±20 V. The AD7616
    has 1 MΩ analog input impedance regardless of sampling frequency. The single supply
    operation, on-chip filtering, and high input impedance eliminate the need for
    driver op-amps and external bipolar supplies.

    Each device contains analog input clamp protection, a dual, 16-bit charge redistribution
    successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a flexible digital
    filter, a 2.5 V reference and reference buffer, and high-speed serial and parallel
    interfaces.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.
