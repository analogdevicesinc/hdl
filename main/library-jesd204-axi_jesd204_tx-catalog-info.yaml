  description: >
    The :adi:ADI <> JESD204B/C Link Transmit Peripheral implements the Link layer
    handling of a JESD204 transmit logic device. Implements the 8B/10B based Link
    layer defined in JESD204C standard that is similar to the Link layer defined in
    JESD204B.

    This includes handling of the SYSREF and SYNC~ and controlling the link state
    machine accordingly, as well as performing per lane scrambling and character replacement.

    It has been designed for interoperability with ADI JESD204B DAC converter products.
    It implements the 64B/66B-based Link layer defined in the JESD204C standard. This
    includes handling of the SYSREF, per lane encoding of sync header, scrambling
    as per data multi-block CRC generation.

    The type of Link layer is selectable during implementation phase through the LINK_MODE
    synthesis parameter.

    To form a complete JESD204 transmit logic device, it has to be combined with a
    PHY layer and transport layer peripheral.
