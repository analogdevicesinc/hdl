  description: >
    The EVAL-ADMX6001-EBZ is a reference design of a DC-coupled single channel 10GSPS
    digitizer featuring the low noise 12-bit high-speed ADC AD9213 and the 20-bit
    precision ADC AD4080. The dual-path design achieves true low noise digitization
    in the broad band from DC to 5GHz. By biasing the ADC driver ADL5580 with the
    precision DAC LTC2664, it is capable of handling unipolar and bipolar signals
    at various DC levels, maximizing utility of the input dynamic range of AD9213.
    This design is ideal for high performance time-domain instruments such as time-of-flight
    mass spectrometry (TOFMS), distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS), and digital
    oscilloscope.

    The EVAL-ADMX6001-EBZ reference design is a processor based (e.g. Microblaze)
    embedded system.

    The design implements a high-speed receive chain using JESD204B and a precision
    data path using the custom interface IP axi_ad408x.

    The receive chain transports the captured samples from ADC to the system memory
    (DDR). Before transferring the data to DDR the samples are stored in a buffer
    implemented on block rams from the FPGA fabric (util_adcfifo).

    All cores from the receive chain are programmable through an AXI-Lite interface.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx VCU118.
