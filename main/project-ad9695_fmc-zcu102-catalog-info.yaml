  title: AD9695-FMC HDL project
  description: >
    The EVAL-AD9695 is a fully-featured evaluation board for the AD9695, a dual 14-bit,
    1300/625MSPS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring an on-chip buffer and
    a sample-and-hold circuit designed for low power, small size, and ease of use.
    The dual ADC cores feature a multistage, differential pipelined architecture with
    integrated output error correction logic. Each ADC features wide bandwidth inputs
    supporting a variety of user-selectable input ranges. The JESD204B links operate
    in subclass 1, with lane rates up to 16 Gbps.

    The AD9695-FMC reference design is a processor-based embedded system. The design
    consists of a receive chain that transports the captured samples from the ADC
    to the system memory (DDR).

    All cores from the receive chain are programmable through an AXI-Lite interface.

    It targets the AMD Xilinx ZCU102.
