# XCVR-WIZARD HDL Project

- HDL project documentation: https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/library/jesd204/xgt_wizard/index.html

## Building the project

This project is used internally to generate transceiver configuration files for
Xilinx carriers. The generated configuration files are later parsed and used by
other HDL projects (e.g., ADRV9009, DAQ2, DAQ3).
Please enter the folder for the FPGA carrier you want to use
and read the README.md.
