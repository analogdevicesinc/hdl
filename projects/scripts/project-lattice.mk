## Make script for building Lattice projects. ##################################
#
# * Make commands: all pb rd rd-force pb-force clean clean-all clean-pb clean-rd.
#
# * pb: checks if dependencies exist and builds the Propel Builder project.
#   (block design)
# * rd: checks for dependencies and builds the Radiant Project
#   based on Propel Builder Project.
# * pb-force and rd-force: you can build the respective projects without
#   checking for dependencies.
# * clean: deletes the whole project and log files.
# * clean-all: deletes all the generated files during build.
# * clean-pb: deletes the Propel Builder project files and directories.
#   After this you can rebuild the Propel Builder project separately by
#   'make pb' but only if you created the project without using the '-sbc'
#   template file option wich is used in official project creation command,
#   because if you create with '-sbc' option the command will not create
#   the project becouse the first <project_name> folder from
#   <adi_project_folder>/<project_name>/<project_name> is not deleted,
#   becouse that contains the Radiant project files. Also deletes the log
#   file for Propel Builder project.
# * clean-rd: cleans the content of <adi_project_folder>/<project_name>/
#   folder ralated to Radiant project except the
#   <adi_project_folder>/<project_name>/<project_name> folder.
#   Also deletes the log file for Radiant project.
#
# * Note: The limitation for Propel Builder project is that it does not exit
#   with error code no matter if the design was built or failed to,
#   so the red FAILED message will never appear by default.
#   As a workaround I search for the Propel Builder project build targets,
#   if one of them is not found I write the red FAILED message and exit
#   with error code. That means the Propel Builder project failed to build.
