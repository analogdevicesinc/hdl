# AD_FMCLIDAR1_EBZ HDL reference design

## Overview

The following design supports both Xilinx and Intel FPGA's. The [AD_FMCLIDAR1_EBZ](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/AD-FMCLIDAR1-EBZ.html)
prototyping system connects to the FPGA carrier board through a FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Cad)
high pin count connector.  

Detailed user guide of the prototyping platform can be found [here](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmclidar1-ebz).

Currently supported carriers:

|  Carrier name | FMC connector |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  ZC706        |   FMC_HPC     |
|  ZCU102       |   HPC0        |
|  Arria10SOC   |   FMCA_HPC    |

The design is easily portable to any Xilinx or Intel FPGA carrier board, which
has an FMC HPC connector, and have all the required connections. (See more info
in [system_constr.xdc](./zc706/system_constr.xdc) or [system_project.tcl](./a10soc/system_project.tcl))

You can find a porting guide in the [wiki.analog.com](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/hdl/porting_project_quick_start_guide).

### Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| common    | Common verilog and block design Tcl files |
| zc706     | ZC706 specific source files |

More information about the directory structure of the HDL repository can be found [here](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/git).

## Build instructions

The project is using GNU Make for build and bitstream generation. Change your directory
to your targeted carrier and run **make**.

More information about how to build HDL projects can be found [here](http://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/build).

## Architecture

The main scope of the HDL design is to provide all the required digital interfaces
for the data acquisition board of the prototyping system.

The following block diagram presents the simplified system architecture:

### AXI_LASER_DRIVER IP

The axi_laser_driver IP is responsible to generate a narrow pulse for the laser
driver circuit, to control the TIA channel selection on the analog front end (AFE)
board, and to synchronize the data acquisition to the generated pulses.

More information about the IP can be found [here](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/axi_laser_driver).
