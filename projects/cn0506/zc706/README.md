# CN0506/ZC706 HDL Project

## Building the project

The parameters configurable through the `make` command, can be found below, as well as in the **system_project.tcl** file; it contains the default configuration.

```
cd projects/cn0506/zc706
make
```

The overwritable parameter from the environment is:

- INTF_CFG - defines the MAC to PHY interface type (MII, RGMII or RMII)

### Example configurations

- Connect on FMC LPC
- VADJ = 2.5V

#### RGMII mode (default)

- RGMII mode uses a GMII-to-RGMII converter, connected to PS7's Ethernet 0 (PHY 0) and Ethernet 1 (PHY 1)

This specific command is equivalent to running `make` only:

```
cd projects/cn0506/zc706
make INTF_CFG=RGMII
```

#### MII mode

- Connected to PS7's Ethernet 0 (PHY 0) and Ethernet 1 (PHY 1)

```
cd projects/cn0506/zc706
make INTF_CFG=MII
