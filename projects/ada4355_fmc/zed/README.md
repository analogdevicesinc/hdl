The parameters configurable through the `make` command, can be found below, as well as in the **system_project.tcl** file; it contains the default
configuration.

```
cd projects/ada4355_fmc/zed
make
```

This project supports two pinout variants, which are differentiated by how the frame clock signals are distributed.

For one pinout version, the XDC constraints are not optimized for ISERDES, as the frame clock signals are located in a different I/O bank from the other related signals. To address this, a BUFMRCE buffer is used to distribute the frame clock to all ISERDES instances.

The overwritable parameters from the environment:

- BUFMRCE_EN - Specifies the evaluation board type
  - 0 - pinout with optimized constraints (default)
  - 1 - pinout with non-optimized constraints

### Example configurations

#### BUFMRCE_EN disabled (default)

This specific command is equivalent to running `make` only:

```
make BUFMRCE_EN=0
```

#### BUFMRCE_EN enabled

```
make BUFMRCE_EN=1
```
